A member of the  Indian National Congress  (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th  leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha  and as the member of the  Lok Sabha  for  Rae Bareli ,  Uttar Pradesh , since June 2024. [ c ] [ d ]  He previously represented the constituency of  Wayanad ,  Kerala , from 2019 to 2024, and  Amethi ,  Uttar Pradesh , from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the  party president  of the  Indian National Congress  from December 2017 to July 2019.\n A member of the  Nehru–Gandhi political family , he spent his early years between  Delhi  and  Dehradun , remaining largely outside the  public sphere  during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended  The Doon School . However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at  St. Stephen's College  before moving to  Harvard University . Following his father's  assassination  and subsequent security concerns, he moved to  Rollins College  in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a  M.Phil.  from  Cambridge , Gandhi initiated his professional career with the  Monitor Group , a management consulting firm in  London . Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded a technology outsourcing firm based in  Mumbai . He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the  Indian Youth Congress  and  National Students Union of India , while also being a trustee of the  Rajiv Gandhi Foundation  and  Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust .\n Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the  Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency  in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as  Leader of the Opposition .\n \n \n Early life and background \n Further information:  Nehru–Gandhi family \n Gandhi along with  Sonia Gandhi , then  POI   Pratibha Patil , then  VPOI   Ansari , then  PM  at the memorial of his grandmother  Indira Gandhi \n Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in  Delhi . [ 12 ]  He was the first of two children born to  Rajiv Gandhi , who later served as the 6th prime minister of India, and  Sonia Gandhi , who went on to become the  president of the Indian National Congress . As the grandson of former prime minister  Indira Gandhi , his lineage is deeply rooted in Indian political history. His paternal grandfather,  Feroze Gandhi , hailed from  Gujarat  and was of  Parsi  descent. [ 13 ]  Furthermore, he is the great-grandson of India's inaugural prime minister,  Jawaharlal Nehru .\n Gandhi completed his elementary education at  St. Columba's School  in New Delhi. [ 14 ]  He then attended  The Doon School  in Dehradun (an elite all-boys' boarding school, also the alma mater of his father,  Rajiv Gandhi ) from 1981 to 1983. [ 15 ]  At Doon, Gandhi studied alongside notable contemporaries, including former Congress members  Jyotiraditya Scindia  and  Jitin Prasada . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  Following the  assassination of Indira Gandhi  by Sikhs in her personal guard on 31 October 1984, his father entered politics and became the 6th prime minister of India. Due to security threats from  Sikh extremists , Gandhi and his sister Priyanka were  home-schooled , taking examinations under the supervision of teachers. [ 18 ]  Spending their childhood away from media attention, Gandhi and  his sister  kept low profiles, appearing with their parents at a handful of public occasions. [ 19 ] \n Gandhi joined  St. Stephen's College , Delhi, an affiliated college of the  University of Delhi , in 1989 for his undergraduate education. [ 20 ]  Gandhi's academic performance in Class XII, with a score of 61 per cent in the  CBSE school certificate , was perceived as not particularly strong. [ 21 ]  He gained admission to St. Stephen's College for  BA (Honors)  History through the sports quota, which granted a 10 per cent advantage in exam scores to promising athletes; per  National Rifle Association of India  testimonials, Gandhi stood 4th in the 32nd  National Shooting Competition  held in New Delhi from 26 December 1988 to 5 January 1989. [ 21 ]  Gandhi had finished fourth in the Centre Fire Pistol 25 M (Indian Rule) Men's civilian event with a score of 371 out of 400 points. [ 21 ]  By July 1989, Gandhi had won eight national awards. In 1991, following the  assassination of Rajiv Gandhi  by the  LTTE  during an election rally, Gandhi left St. Stephen's and moved to  Harvard University . Due to security concerns, he subsequently relocated to  Rollins College  in  Florida . He further went on to obtain an  Master of Philosophy  (MPhil) in  Development Studies , from  Trinity College , Cambridge in 1995. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  Following his father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, there was a heightened threat perception to the family, those closest to Gandhi were paranoid about his safety and might have forced him to take cover under the misleading surname \"Vinci\". [ 24 ] \n After completing higher education, Gandhi worked at the  Monitor Group , a  management consulting  firm set up by  Michael Porter  of  Harvard Business School , in  London  for three years. [ 25 ]  In 2002, he returned to India and established his  technology consultancy , Backops Services Private Ltd, in  Mumbai , where he served as one of the directors of the firm. [ 26 ]  Subsequently, he founded BackOps UK, a company that secured defence contracts from foreign suppliers. [ 27 ] \n \n Political career \n Formative years \n Rahul Gandhi (right) with  Hillary Clinton ,  Sonia Gandhi , and  Karan Singh  in New Delhi, 2009 \n In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the  14th general elections  from his father's former constituency of  Amethi  in  Uttar Pradesh  for the  Lok Sabha , India's lower house of parliament. [ 28 ]  His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of  Raebareli . When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister  Priyanka Gandhi  as the more charismatic and probable successor. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous  political family  would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population. [ 29 ]  In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce  caste  and  religious  tensions. [ 30 ] \n After being out of power for a record eight years, the Congress party returned to power, winning a total of 145 seats in the 2004 Indian general election. A  coalition government  was formed at the center by Congress with the backing of regional parties. Gandhi secured a victory by a substantial margin of over 100,000 votes, thereby maintaining the stronghold of his family in Uttar Pradesh. [ 31 ]  The party performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh, as it held 10 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with a vote share of 12.53 per cent. [ 32 ]   Gandhi did not hold any official role or position within the government. [ 33 ]  From 2004 to 2006, Gandhi served as a member for the  Standing Committee  on  Home Affairs . Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the member of the Standing Committee on  Human Resource Development . [ 34 ] \n Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, managed their mother's campaign for re-election to  Raebareilly  in 2006, which was won with a margin of over 400,000 votes. [ 35 ]  He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the  2007 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election ; Congress did not perform well in those elections, winning 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53 per cent of the vote. [ 36 ]  On 24 September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as the general secretary of the  All India Congress Committee , the governing body of the Congress party, as part of a reshuffle of the party secretariat. [ 37 ]  In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the  Indian Youth Congress  and the  National Students Union of India . [ 38 ] \n For the  2009 Indian general election , Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107  constituencies . [ 39 ] [ 40 ]  His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party's vision and agenda for the country. [ 41 ]  He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women's empowerment. Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country's future. [ 42 ]   The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led  United Progressive Alliance  (UPA) government. [ 43 ]  The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats. While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties. [ 44 ]  Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes. [ 45 ]  Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] \n \n Youth politics \n In September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the  Indian Youth Congress  (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the  National Students Union of India  (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community. [ 48 ]  As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations. After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million. [ 49 ]  The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in  New Delhi  to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC's  think tank . [ 52 ]  In 2009, during Gandhi's visit to  West Bengal , the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members. [ 53 ]  Similarly, the IYC acquired around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh. After his visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions. [ 54 ] \n While serving as the general secretary of the NSUI, Gandhi played an active role in strengthening the organisation and increasing  student participation  in politics. [ 50 ]  Under his leadership, the NSUI initiated programs and campaigns to address issues affecting the student community, such as the quality of education, employment opportunities, and social justice. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  Gandhi also advocated for greater student representation in decision-making processes and supported  student leaders  in their endeavours. [ 58 ] \n \n Congress leadership \n Ahead of the  2014 Indian general election , Gandhi was named the vice-president of the Indian National Congress, effectively making him the party's second-in-command. Gandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi, [ 59 ]  and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress. [ 60 ]  Gandhi retained the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP's  Smriti Irani , by a margin of 107,000 votes. [ 47 ] [ 61 ]  The Congress party suffered a massive defeat, winning 44 seats—its worst performance ever in the Lok Sabha elections. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  The UPA also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won 59 seats, compared to the 262 seats won in 2009. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  Following the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign from his positions which was rejected by the Congress Working Committee. [ 66 ] \n Gandhi led the  2019 election campaign  of the Congress party. During  campaign, Gandhi announced \"Nyay\" (Nyuntam Aay Yojana— Minimum Income Guarantee) Scheme promising Rs 6,000 each to 20 per cent poorest households to his election speeches. [ 67 ]  Gandhi also promised to fill 22 lakhs government jobs within one year coming to power at the  Centre . Gandhi used the slogan \" Chowkidar Chor Hai \" as a jibe against Narendra Modi, BJP's prime ministerial candidate during his election rallies. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]  The slogan was aimed at Modi about the alleged irregularities and favouritism in awarding the contracts for the  Rafale fighter jet deal . [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  Post election results the INC won 52 seats, eight more than the previous election. Its vote percentage once again fell below 20 per cent. Gandhi won the Wayanad seat with over 60 per cent vote share. [ 72 ]  He lost his existing seat of Amethi to  Smriti Irani  of the BJP by a margin of 55,120 votes. [ 73 ] \n Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded political initiatives, including the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , which were designed to address pressing social and economic issues facing the country. These campaigns aimed to foster unity and counter divisive politics, while also enhancing the visibility of the Indian National Congress (INC) among voters. The INC secured 99 seats in the elections, representing an improvement from previous electoral performances and allowing the party to reclaim the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in ten years. In the elections, Gandhi successfully won the  Rae Bareli  constituency, succeeding his mother,  Sonia Gandhi . \n As a member of Parliament of India since 2004, Gandhi has served as a member of several  parliamentary committees  including  Home Affairs ,  Human Resource Development ,  External Affairs ,  Ministry of Finance  and  Corporate Affairs  and  Defence .\n \n National Herald case \n The  National Herald case  revolves around allegations of financial irregularities and misuse of funds related to the  National Herald  newspaper. The case garnered attention when former  BJP  leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders— Motilal Vora ,  Oscar Fernandes , Suman Dubey, and  Satyan Pitroda —of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald. The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to \"Associated Journals Limited\" (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper. [ 74 ]  Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around  ₹ 90 crore  (equivalent to  ₹ 202 crore or US$24 million in 2023), was not repaid. Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called \"Young India Ltd\" (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company's shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes. [ 74 ]  As per Swamy, YIL paid  ₹ 54 lakh  (equivalent to  ₹ 1.2 crore or US$140,000 in 2023) to get back ₹90 crore that Associated AJL owed to the Congress party. He also alleged that the loan given to AJL was illegal, as it had been taken from party funds. [ 74 ] \n The case went through various legal proceedings, including hearings in lower courts and the Delhi High Court. In December 2015, the  Delhi High Court  dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi and five others, ordering them to appear in person before the trial court. [ 75 ]  In 2015, the  Supreme Court of India  instructed Swamy to present arguments for expediting the trial in the high court. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were granted bail by the trial court on 19 December 2015. Subsequently, in 2016, the Supreme Court exempted all five accused individuals (including the Gandhis, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, and Suman Dubey) from personally attending court hearings, declining to dismiss the ongoing legal proceedings against them. [ 74 ]  In December 2020, the Delhi court dismissed a petition filed by then-BJP leader  Subramanian Swamy  seeking to summon Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and others as accused in the case. The court held that there was no  prima facie  evidence to suggest their involvement in any corruption conspiracy. [ 76 ]  In 2014, the  Enforcement Directorate  (ED) initiated an investigation into Swamy's complaint to determine if there were any indications of  money laundering . The investigation was closed due to technical reasons. Nonetheless, Swamy wrote to prime minister  Narendra Modi  expressing his suspicions about ED Director Ranjan Katoch. Subsequently, in 2015, Katoch was replaced, and the case was reopened. In December 2015, the  Patiala court  granted bail to the five individuals accused in the case. [ 77 ]  The Congress party objected to Swamy's complaint, calling it “ vindictive politics ”. [ 78 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Gandhi during  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n The Bharat Jodo  Yatra , which translates to \"Unify India March,\" was a campaign organised by the Congress party spanning from 2022 to 2023 with the stated primary objective of promoting national unity and solidarity across the various regions of India. It aimed to mobilise support for the INC and its ideology, emphasising themes of patriotism, cultural heritage, and development. [ 79 ]  Gandhi started the initiative on 7 September 2022 at  Kanyakumari  after paying tributes to his late father  Rajiv Gandhi ,  Swami Vivekananda , and the Tamil poet  Thiruvalluvar . [ 80 ]  The yatra saw Gandhi along with INC leaders, including members of Parliament and notable personalities, travelling across the country, addressing rallies, conducting public meetings, and interacting with citizens. Throughout the yatra, Gandhi focused on issues such as  economic development ,  social justice , and inclusive governance, aiming to strengthen the party's grassroots presence and reinvigorate its political relevance on the national stage. [ 81 ] \n The yatra concluded on 29 January 2023 with the unfurling of the  tricolour flag  at  Lal Chowk ,  Srinagar ; [ 82 ]  it lasted 137 days, covering 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) over nearly five months across 12 states and two union territories. During the yatra, the INC elected a new  party president  and also won a majority in the  2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election , the first majority the party had won by itself since 2018. In the subsequent elections in Karnataka and Telangana in 2023, the Congress party achieved a landslide victory, marked by an increase in both the party's vote share and the number of seats compared to the previous elections in the constituencies through which the march had passed. [ 83 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Attendees displaying banners at the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra gathering \n From 14 January to 20 March 2024, Gandhi led a second yatra across India from east to west, the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ; unlike the previous version, the Yatra was conducted in a hybrid mode. [ 84 ] \n \n Disqualification \n Main article:  Disqualification of Rahul Gandhi \n On 13 April 2019, during a political rally in  Kolar ,  Karnataka, India  before the  17th general election , Gandhi made a remark in Hindi, questioning, \"Why is it that all thieves, whether it be  Nirav Modi ,  Lalit Modi , or  Narendra Modi , have Modi in their names?\". [ 85 ]  A speech comparing Narendra Modi with  Fugitive Economic Offenders  such as  Nirav Modi  and  Lalit Modi . A criminal defamation case was filed by  Purnesh Modi , a  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP) MLA from  Surat West . He alleged that Gandhi had defamed all individuals with the surname Modi. On 16 July 2019, the Surat court excused Gandhi from appearing personally in court due to short notice. On 10 October, he pleaded not guilty in the Surat Court, recording his statements and responding to questions here on 24 June 2021, and again on 29 October. During these appearances, he clarified to the court that he did not intend to defame any community. [ 86 ] \n On 23 March 2023, Gandhi was convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment under charges of defamation. The day following the conviction,  Utpal Kumar Singh , the Lok Sabha  secretary general , announced that Rahul Gandhi would be disqualified as a member of parliament representing the  Wayanad  constituency, effective from 23 March, the date of his conviction. The secretary general further said that this action was taken under Section 8 of the  Representation of the People Act, 1951  (RPA), which deals with the disqualification of convicted representatives in India. [ 87 ]  Gandhi's lawyer  Abhishek Manu Singhvi  appealed at the higher court and secured a one-month stay on the sentence. [ 88 ]  On 5 August, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on Gandhi's conviction and sentence, handed down by Chief Judicial Magistrate in Surat on 23 March 2023. [ 89 ] \n The disqualification of Gandhi prompted widespread reactions and responses, from the Congress party as well as other opposition leaders and lawmakers abroad. [ 90 ]  Legal experts questioned the basis of the charge, as defamation is only actionable against individuals and not a generic class of people. [ 3 ]  The  US House of Representatives ,  Ro Khanna ,  Democrat  co-chair of the India Caucus, described the removal of Gandhi from parliament as a \"deep betrayal\" of India's \"deepest values\". [ 91 ] [ 92 ]  A spokesperson for  Germany's foreign ministry  stated that  Berlin  had \"acknowledged\" the verdict and was monitoring the subsequent steps, including the possibility of an appeal and whether the \"suspension of his mandate\" was deemed justified. [ 93 ]   US Senator   Chris Van Hollen  made a separate comment, stating that the news of the disqualification was \"alarming\". [ 94 ] \n \n Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha (2024–present) \n Following the 2024 general election, he was nominated as the leader of the opposition in  Lok Sabha , reinforcing his role as a prominent figure within the party and the opposition landscape. In his first year in the role, he made 16 speeches in the  17th Lok Sabha , and pressured the government to conduct a nationwide  caste census ; this was adopted by the government in April 2025, as announced by the  Union Railway Minister   Ashwini Vaishnaw . [ 95 ]  Gandhi welcomed the decision, calling it \"the first step towards deep social reform\". [ 96 ] \n \n 2025 vote theft allegations \n Main article:  2025 Mahadevapura Electoral Controversy \n In August 2025, Gandhi alleged irregularities in voter rolls and polling processes, referring to the issue as “vote chori” (“vote theft”), during a press conference on 7 August. [ 97 ]  He cited examples from constituencies including  Mahadevapura  in Karnataka and presented documents which he said showed duplicate and fraudulent voter entries. The Election Commission of India subsequently asked him to provide formal evidence supporting the claims or to withdraw them. Later in the month, Gandhi expanded the allegations to cover multiple parliamentary constituencies and took part in public demonstrations organised by the Indian National Congress on the issue. [ 98 ] \n \n Political positions \n National security \n 68th   United States Secretary of State   John Kerry   with Gandhi at the Roosevelt House in New Delhi. \nIn December 2010, during the  United States diplomatic cables leak ,  WikiLeaks  leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009 after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the general secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the  United States ambassador to India ,  Timothy J. Roemer . In a \"candid conversation\" with Roemer, he said that he believes  Hindu extremists  pose a greater threat to his country than  Muslim  militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP). Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the  Islamist  militant organisation  Lashkar-e-Taiba  (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous  Muslim  population. [ 99 ]  In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson  Ravi Shankar Prasad  slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, \"In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in  Pakistan  and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security.\" Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. [ 100 ]  Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the  RSS  and has compared them to terrorist organisations like  SIMI . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Gandhi with Greek prime minister  George Papandreou  in  Chanakyapuri , New Delhi After the  2013 Muzaffarnagar riots  at a  Madhya Pradesh election rally  in Indore, Gandhi claimed that a police officer told him that Pakistan's military intelligence service,  ISI , was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters. [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The district administration, Uttar Pradesh state government, Union Home Ministry, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  This remark drew heavy criticism from various political outfits such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U). [ 107 ]  Congress's  Jairam Ramesh  said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for this remark. [ 108 ]  In reply to the  ECI's  show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn't intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics. [ 109 ] \n Lokpal \n Gandhi opines that the  Lokpal  should be made a  constitutional body  and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He opined that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption, rather a strong political will is needed to remove corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of  Anna Hazare 's fast. Gandhi's statement was considered a delaying tactic by the opposition and  Team Anna 's members. It was consequently slammed by opposition leaders  Sushma Swaraj  and  Arun Jaitley . [ 110 ]  The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the  Jan Lokpal Bill  report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal be made into a constitutional body.\n \n Farmers and land agitation \n  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  sits next to Gandhi who leads a delegation of leaders from  Bundelkhand  region in New Delhi. 2009 \n On 19 April 2015, Gandhi addressed the farmer and worker's rally, named as  Kisan Khet Mazdoor  Rally in  Ramlila Maidan . Here he made \"references to his agitations in  Niyamgiri  in  Orissa  and Bhatta-Parsaul in Greater Noida in  Uttar Pradesh \". [ 111 ]  The rally was attended by 100,000 people. In the speech he gave, he criticised the Indian prime minister  Narendra Modi  about his comment in  Toronto  where he said that he was \"cleaning the mess created by previous governments\". [ 112 ]  He also said, \"Do you know how Modi won the election?... He borrowed thousands of  crores  from industrialists for his several campaigns and advertisements. How will he pay them back? He will pay them back with your land. He will give your land to his industrialist friends.\" [ 111 ] \n He razzed the government as a \"suit-boot government\", a reference to Modi's monogrammed suit which he wore in the  Republic Day  meeting with  Barack Obama . Moreover, he used the \"acche din government\" jibe (which was Modi's election campaign slogan meaning \"good days government\") and mentioned that it had \"failed the country\". [ 113 ] \n A land bill was introduced by the BJP government in the parliament in May which was criticised by the opposition parties. [ 114 ]  Accusing the government of \"murdering\"  UPA 's land bill, [ 115 ]  Gandhi promised to prevent the bill from being passed, if not in the parliament then would \"stop you [  BJP  government] on streets\". He further accused the government of diluting the bill and called it \"anti-farmer\". [ 114 ]  Gandhi also drew a parallel between \"daylight robbery\" and the bill. [ 116 ]  On 26 May, the day of the Modi government's first anniversary, Gandhi commented at a rally in  Kozhikode  \"Unfortunately, birthday celebrations is only for a few powerful friends of the government. Kisan, farmers and mazdoor have nothing to celebrate.\" [ 117 ] \n \n Women's empowerment and LGBTQ rights \n .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:.5em 1.4em .8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:.5em 0 .8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5em auto .8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright span{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox>blockquote{margin:0;padding:0;border-left:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{text-align:center;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote>:first-child{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote:last-child>:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" “ \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" ” \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quote-title,.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quotebox-quote{display:block}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 .8em!important;float:none!important}} \n \n \"India will be truly successful only when women occupy equal space in our society. They must take their rightful place in politics and shape India's destiny.\"\n \n \n Gandhi's remarks on Women empowerment. [ 118 ] \n  \n Gandhi has spoken publicly about the importance of  women's empowerment  and gender equality in India. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  While inaugurating 'Utsaah', a Kerala  Mahila Congress  convention in Kochi, Gandhi stated that the Congress party would actively promote women within its organizational structure and set a target to have 50 per cent of women as chief ministers within the next 10 years. Gandhi initiated the  Self-Help Groups  amongthe women in the villages of  Amethi . [ 121 ]  The primary focus of this scheme was to bring women together and empower them with information and decision making capabilities. [ 122 ]  He has called for increased representation of women in politics and for the eradication of gender-based violence. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ]  Under the  second Manmohan Singh ministry , a  Women's Reservation Bill  to require that a third of Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats be reserved for women was introduced in the  Rajya Sabha .  \nGandhi backed the bill, stating, \"Women do not need any protection. If you give them their rights, they can protect themselves\". [ 126 ]  This bill passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010, it never received a vote in the Lok Sabha and eventually lapsed due to its pending status. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In 2019, while addressing students in  Chennai , Gandhi again called for 33 per cent reservation of all parliamentary  Lok Sabha  and state legislative assembly seats for women, as well as government jobs. [ 131 ] \n On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India revoked  Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , an act which criminalised homosexual sex between adults. Gandhi supported this move, stating that he believed that issues related to personal freedom should be left to the individual. [ 132 ]  He opined that it's essential to uphold the constitutional guarantee of life and liberty to all citizens of India. [ 133 ]  Under Gandhi's leadership, the Congress appointed a transgender woman as national general secretary in the  women’s wing —seen as a step toward mainstreaming transgender individuals. [ 134 ] \n \n Climate and energy \n Gandhi advocates the transition to renewable energy sources and has called for increased investment in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy technologies. [ 135 ]  He has been very concerned about the  environmental degradation  of the world and has said that unless environmental problems are made a political issue, they will not get the attention they deserve. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] \n Gandhi criticised the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft by calling it \"dangerous\" and said that its long term consequences will be harmful. Calling it a disaster, he said that it will silence the communities who will be directly impacted by environmental degradation. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] \n \n Economy \n Gandhi at  Stanford University  in May 2023, delivers address on India's democracy, United States relationship \n Gandhi while addressing All India Congress Committee (AICC) in  Jaipur , called for an end to  red tape  and outdated laws that slow job creation. [ 140 ] \nGandhi views the economic policies of  Modi Government  as fundamentally to benefit the 2-3 billionaires and has described them as  crony capitalists . [ 141 ]  Calling the \"crony capitalists\" as best friends of Modi, he has been critical of the privatisation of government assets. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]  He is of the view that  RSS  and crony capitalists are colluding to control India. [ 144 ]  He has been specifically harsh on Indian billionaire  Gautam Adani , to whom he said the Modi Government has been very favourable. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ]  He sees the rise of Adani as a direct consequence of crony capitalism. [ 148 ] [ 149 ]  He said that he is not anti-business and supports fairness. [ 150 ]  Disagreeing with privatisation of  PSUs , he said that Congress will not allow the privatisation if it comes to power. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ]  Citing the report on inequality by  Oxfam , he said that rising economic inequality is the result of Modi Government's economic policies. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] \n \n Demonetisation \n Gandhi has been very critical of the  Modi government 's  demonetisation  of  ₹500  and  ₹1,000  banknotes of the  Mahatma Gandhi Series . [ 157 ]  He has called it a \"tragedy\" and a \"disaster\" that has negatively impacted the Indian economy and the lives of ordinary citizens. Gandhi has also accused the government of carrying out the policy without adequate planning and causing immense hardship to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. He said that demonetisation is a fundamental failure of policy design [ 158 ]  and has alleged that it was a deliberate move by \"PayPM\" to help 2-3 billionaires to monopolise the economy. Terming demonetisation as the country's “biggest scam”, [ 159 ] \n During his public speeches and political rallies, Gandhi has consistently criticised the demonetisation move, claiming that it failed to achieve its intended objectives of combating black money and curbing corruption. [ 160 ]  He has also argued that the policy was implemented without proper consultation with experts or the  opposition parties . Gandhi further asserted that, demonetisation caused significant disruption to farmers, and rendered millions jobless in small and medium-sized businesses, and workers in the informal sector.

A member of the  Indian National Congress  (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th  leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha  and as the member of the  Lok Sabha  for  Rae Bareli ,  Uttar Pradesh , since June 2024. [ c ] [ d ]  He previously represented the constituency of  Wayanad ,  Kerala , from 2019 to 2024, and  Amethi ,  Uttar Pradesh , from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the  party president  of the  Indian National Congress  from December 2017 to July 2019.\n A member of the  Nehru–Gandhi political family , he spent his early years between  Delhi  and  Dehradun , remaining largely outside the  public sphere  during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended  The Doon School . However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at  St. Stephen's College  before moving to  Harvard University . Following his father's  assassination  and subsequent security concerns, he moved to  Rollins College  in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a  M.Phil.  from  Cambridge , Gandhi initiated his professional career with the  Monitor Group , a management consulting firm in  London . Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded a technology outsourcing firm based in  Mumbai . He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the  Indian Youth Congress  and  National Students Union of India , while also being a trustee of the  Rajiv Gandhi Foundation  and  Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust .\n Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the  Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency  in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as  Leader of the Opposition .\n \n \n Early life and background \n Further information:  Nehru–Gandhi family \n Gandhi along with  Sonia Gandhi , then  POI   Pratibha Patil , then  VPOI   Ansari , then  PM  at the memorial of his grandmother  Indira Gandhi \n Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in  Delhi . [ 12 ]  He was the first of two children born to  Rajiv Gandhi , who later served as the 6th prime minister of India, and  Sonia Gandhi , who went on to become the  president of the Indian National Congress . As the grandson of former prime minister  Indira Gandhi , his lineage is deeply rooted in Indian political history. His paternal grandfather,  Feroze Gandhi , hailed from  Gujarat  and was of  Parsi  descent. [ 13 ]  Furthermore, he is the great-grandson of India's inaugural prime minister,  Jawaharlal Nehru .\n Gandhi completed his elementary education at  St. Columba's School  in New Delhi. [ 14 ]  He then attended  The Doon School  in Dehradun (an elite all-boys' boarding school, also the alma mater of his father,  Rajiv Gandhi ) from 1981 to 1983. [ 15 ]  At Doon, Gandhi studied alongside notable contemporaries, including former Congress members  Jyotiraditya Scindia  and  Jitin Prasada . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  Following the  assassination of Indira Gandhi  by Sikhs in her personal guard on 31 October 1984, his father entered politics and became the 6th prime minister of India. Due to security threats from  Sikh extremists , Gandhi and his sister Priyanka were  home-schooled , taking examinations under the supervision of teachers. [ 18 ]  Spending their childhood away from media attention, Gandhi and  his sister  kept low profiles, appearing with their parents at a handful of public occasions. [ 19 ] \n Gandhi joined  St. Stephen's College , Delhi, an affiliated college of the  University of Delhi , in 1989 for his undergraduate education. [ 20 ]  Gandhi's academic performance in Class XII, with a score of 61 per cent in the  CBSE school certificate , was perceived as not particularly strong. [ 21 ]  He gained admission to St. Stephen's College for  BA (Honors)  History through the sports quota, which granted a 10 per cent advantage in exam scores to promising athletes; per  National Rifle Association of India  testimonials, Gandhi stood 4th in the 32nd  National Shooting Competition  held in New Delhi from 26 December 1988 to 5 January 1989. [ 21 ]  Gandhi had finished fourth in the Centre Fire Pistol 25 M (Indian Rule) Men's civilian event with a score of 371 out of 400 points. [ 21 ]  By July 1989, Gandhi had won eight national awards. In 1991, following the  assassination of Rajiv Gandhi  by the  LTTE  during an election rally, Gandhi left St. Stephen's and moved to  Harvard University . Due to security concerns, he subsequently relocated to  Rollins College  in  Florida . He further went on to obtain an  Master of Philosophy  (MPhil) in  Development Studies , from  Trinity College , Cambridge in 1995. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  Following his father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, there was a heightened threat perception to the family, those closest to Gandhi were paranoid about his safety and might have forced him to take cover under the misleading surname \"Vinci\". [ 24 ] \n After completing higher education, Gandhi worked at the  Monitor Group , a  management consulting  firm set up by  Michael Porter  of  Harvard Business School , in  London  for three years. [ 25 ]  In 2002, he returned to India and established his  technology consultancy , Backops Services Private Ltd, in  Mumbai , where he served as one of the directors of the firm. [ 26 ]  Subsequently, he founded BackOps UK, a company that secured defence contracts from foreign suppliers. [ 27 ] \n \n Political career \n Formative years \n Rahul Gandhi (right) with  Hillary Clinton ,  Sonia Gandhi , and  Karan Singh  in New Delhi, 2009 \n In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the  14th general elections  from his father's former constituency of  Amethi  in  Uttar Pradesh  for the  Lok Sabha , India's lower house of parliament. [ 28 ]  His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of  Raebareli . When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister  Priyanka Gandhi  as the more charismatic and probable successor. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous  political family  would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population. [ 29 ]  In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce  caste  and  religious  tensions. [ 30 ] \n After being out of power for a record eight years, the Congress party returned to power, winning a total of 145 seats in the 2004 Indian general election. A  coalition government  was formed at the center by Congress with the backing of regional parties. Gandhi secured a victory by a substantial margin of over 100,000 votes, thereby maintaining the stronghold of his family in Uttar Pradesh. [ 31 ]  The party performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh, as it held 10 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with a vote share of 12.53 per cent. [ 32 ]   Gandhi did not hold any official role or position within the government. [ 33 ]  From 2004 to 2006, Gandhi served as a member for the  Standing Committee  on  Home Affairs . Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the member of the Standing Committee on  Human Resource Development . [ 34 ] \n Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, managed their mother's campaign for re-election to  Raebareilly  in 2006, which was won with a margin of over 400,000 votes. [ 35 ]  He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the  2007 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election ; Congress did not perform well in those elections, winning 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53 per cent of the vote. [ 36 ]  On 24 September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as the general secretary of the  All India Congress Committee , the governing body of the Congress party, as part of a reshuffle of the party secretariat. [ 37 ]  In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the  Indian Youth Congress  and the  National Students Union of India . [ 38 ] \n For the  2009 Indian general election , Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107  constituencies . [ 39 ] [ 40 ]  His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party's vision and agenda for the country. [ 41 ]  He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women's empowerment. Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country's future. [ 42 ]   The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led  United Progressive Alliance  (UPA) government. [ 43 ]  The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats. While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties. [ 44 ]  Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes. [ 45 ]  Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] \n \n Youth politics \n In September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the  Indian Youth Congress  (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the  National Students Union of India  (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community. [ 48 ]  As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations. After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million. [ 49 ]  The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in  New Delhi  to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC's  think tank . [ 52 ]  In 2009, during Gandhi's visit to  West Bengal , the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members. [ 53 ]  Similarly, the IYC acquired around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh. After his visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions. [ 54 ] \n While serving as the general secretary of the NSUI, Gandhi played an active role in strengthening the organisation and increasing  student participation  in politics. [ 50 ]  Under his leadership, the NSUI initiated programs and campaigns to address issues affecting the student community, such as the quality of education, employment opportunities, and social justice. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  Gandhi also advocated for greater student representation in decision-making processes and supported  student leaders  in their endeavours. [ 58 ] \n \n Congress leadership \n Ahead of the  2014 Indian general election , Gandhi was named the vice-president of the Indian National Congress, effectively making him the party's second-in-command. Gandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi, [ 59 ]  and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress. [ 60 ]  Gandhi retained the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP's  Smriti Irani , by a margin of 107,000 votes. [ 47 ] [ 61 ]  The Congress party suffered a massive defeat, winning 44 seats—its worst performance ever in the Lok Sabha elections. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  The UPA also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won 59 seats, compared to the 262 seats won in 2009. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  Following the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign from his positions which was rejected by the Congress Working Committee. [ 66 ] \n Gandhi led the  2019 election campaign  of the Congress party. During  campaign, Gandhi announced \"Nyay\" (Nyuntam Aay Yojana— Minimum Income Guarantee) Scheme promising Rs 6,000 each to 20 per cent poorest households to his election speeches. [ 67 ]  Gandhi also promised to fill 22 lakhs government jobs within one year coming to power at the  Centre . Gandhi used the slogan \" Chowkidar Chor Hai \" as a jibe against Narendra Modi, BJP's prime ministerial candidate during his election rallies. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]  The slogan was aimed at Modi about the alleged irregularities and favouritism in awarding the contracts for the  Rafale fighter jet deal . [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  Post election results the INC won 52 seats, eight more than the previous election. Its vote percentage once again fell below 20 per cent. Gandhi won the Wayanad seat with over 60 per cent vote share. [ 72 ]  He lost his existing seat of Amethi to  Smriti Irani  of the BJP by a margin of 55,120 votes. [ 73 ] \n Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded political initiatives, including the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , which were designed to address pressing social and economic issues facing the country. These campaigns aimed to foster unity and counter divisive politics, while also enhancing the visibility of the Indian National Congress (INC) among voters. The INC secured 99 seats in the elections, representing an improvement from previous electoral performances and allowing the party to reclaim the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in ten years. In the elections, Gandhi successfully won the  Rae Bareli  constituency, succeeding his mother,  Sonia Gandhi . \n As a member of Parliament of India since 2004, Gandhi has served as a member of several  parliamentary committees  including  Home Affairs ,  Human Resource Development ,  External Affairs ,  Ministry of Finance  and  Corporate Affairs  and  Defence .\n \n National Herald case \n The  National Herald case  revolves around allegations of financial irregularities and misuse of funds related to the  National Herald  newspaper. The case garnered attention when former  BJP  leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders— Motilal Vora ,  Oscar Fernandes , Suman Dubey, and  Satyan Pitroda —of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald. The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to \"Associated Journals Limited\" (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper. [ 74 ]  Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around  ₹ 90 crore  (equivalent to  ₹ 202 crore or US$24 million in 2023), was not repaid. Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called \"Young India Ltd\" (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company's shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes. [ 74 ]  As per Swamy, YIL paid  ₹ 54 lakh  (equivalent to  ₹ 1.2 crore or US$140,000 in 2023) to get back ₹90 crore that Associated AJL owed to the Congress party. He also alleged that the loan given to AJL was illegal, as it had been taken from party funds. [ 74 ] \n The case went through various legal proceedings, including hearings in lower courts and the Delhi High Court. In December 2015, the  Delhi High Court  dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi and five others, ordering them to appear in person before the trial court. [ 75 ]  In 2015, the  Supreme Court of India  instructed Swamy to present arguments for expediting the trial in the high court. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were granted bail by the trial court on 19 December 2015. Subsequently, in 2016, the Supreme Court exempted all five accused individuals (including the Gandhis, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, and Suman Dubey) from personally attending court hearings, declining to dismiss the ongoing legal proceedings against them. [ 74 ]  In December 2020, the Delhi court dismissed a petition filed by then-BJP leader  Subramanian Swamy  seeking to summon Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and others as accused in the case. The court held that there was no  prima facie  evidence to suggest their involvement in any corruption conspiracy. [ 76 ]  In 2014, the  Enforcement Directorate  (ED) initiated an investigation into Swamy's complaint to determine if there were any indications of  money laundering . The investigation was closed due to technical reasons. Nonetheless, Swamy wrote to prime minister  Narendra Modi  expressing his suspicions about ED Director Ranjan Katoch. Subsequently, in 2015, Katoch was replaced, and the case was reopened. In December 2015, the  Patiala court  granted bail to the five individuals accused in the case. [ 77 ]  The Congress party objected to Swamy's complaint, calling it “ vindictive politics ”. [ 78 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Gandhi during  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n The Bharat Jodo  Yatra , which translates to \"Unify India March,\" was a campaign organised by the Congress party spanning from 2022 to 2023 with the stated primary objective of promoting national unity and solidarity across the various regions of India. It aimed to mobilise support for the INC and its ideology, emphasising themes of patriotism, cultural heritage, and development. [ 79 ]  Gandhi started the initiative on 7 September 2022 at  Kanyakumari  after paying tributes to his late father  Rajiv Gandhi ,  Swami Vivekananda , and the Tamil poet  Thiruvalluvar . [ 80 ]  The yatra saw Gandhi along with INC leaders, including members of Parliament and notable personalities, travelling across the country, addressing rallies, conducting public meetings, and interacting with citizens. Throughout the yatra, Gandhi focused on issues such as  economic development ,  social justice , and inclusive governance, aiming to strengthen the party's grassroots presence and reinvigorate its political relevance on the national stage. [ 81 ] \n The yatra concluded on 29 January 2023 with the unfurling of the  tricolour flag  at  Lal Chowk ,  Srinagar ; [ 82 ]  it lasted 137 days, covering 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) over nearly five months across 12 states and two union territories. During the yatra, the INC elected a new  party president  and also won a majority in the  2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election , the first majority the party had won by itself since 2018. In the subsequent elections in Karnataka and Telangana in 2023, the Congress party achieved a landslide victory, marked by an increase in both the party's vote share and the number of seats compared to the previous elections in the constituencies through which the march had passed. [ 83 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Attendees displaying banners at the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra gathering \n From 14 January to 20 March 2024, Gandhi led a second yatra across India from east to west, the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ; unlike the previous version, the Yatra was conducted in a hybrid mode. [ 84 ] \n \n Disqualification \n Main article:  Disqualification of Rahul Gandhi \n On 13 April 2019, during a political rally in  Kolar ,  Karnataka, India  before the  17th general election , Gandhi made a remark in Hindi, questioning, \"Why is it that all thieves, whether it be  Nirav Modi ,  Lalit Modi , or  Narendra Modi , have Modi in their names?\". [ 85 ]  A speech comparing Narendra Modi with  Fugitive Economic Offenders  such as  Nirav Modi  and  Lalit Modi . A criminal defamation case was filed by  Purnesh Modi , a  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP) MLA from  Surat West . He alleged that Gandhi had defamed all individuals with the surname Modi. On 16 July 2019, the Surat court excused Gandhi from appearing personally in court due to short notice. On 10 October, he pleaded not guilty in the Surat Court, recording his statements and responding to questions here on 24 June 2021, and again on 29 October. During these appearances, he clarified to the court that he did not intend to defame any community. [ 86 ] \n On 23 March 2023, Gandhi was convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment under charges of defamation. The day following the conviction,  Utpal Kumar Singh , the Lok Sabha  secretary general , announced that Rahul Gandhi would be disqualified as a member of parliament representing the  Wayanad  constituency, effective from 23 March, the date of his conviction. The secretary general further said that this action was taken under Section 8 of the  Representation of the People Act, 1951  (RPA), which deals with the disqualification of convicted representatives in India. [ 87 ]  Gandhi's lawyer  Abhishek Manu Singhvi  appealed at the higher court and secured a one-month stay on the sentence. [ 88 ]  On 5 August, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on Gandhi's conviction and sentence, handed down by Chief Judicial Magistrate in Surat on 23 March 2023. [ 89 ] \n The disqualification of Gandhi prompted widespread reactions and responses, from the Congress party as well as other opposition leaders and lawmakers abroad. [ 90 ]  Legal experts questioned the basis of the charge, as defamation is only actionable against individuals and not a generic class of people. [ 3 ]  The  US House of Representatives ,  Ro Khanna ,  Democrat  co-chair of the India Caucus, described the removal of Gandhi from parliament as a \"deep betrayal\" of India's \"deepest values\". [ 91 ] [ 92 ]  A spokesperson for  Germany's foreign ministry  stated that  Berlin  had \"acknowledged\" the verdict and was monitoring the subsequent steps, including the possibility of an appeal and whether the \"suspension of his mandate\" was deemed justified. [ 93 ]   US Senator   Chris Van Hollen  made a separate comment, stating that the news of the disqualification was \"alarming\". [ 94 ] \n \n Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha (2024–present) \n Following the 2024 general election, he was nominated as the leader of the opposition in  Lok Sabha , reinforcing his role as a prominent figure within the party and the opposition landscape. In his first year in the role, he made 16 speeches in the  17th Lok Sabha , and pressured the government to conduct a nationwide  caste census ; this was adopted by the government in April 2025, as announced by the  Union Railway Minister   Ashwini Vaishnaw . [ 95 ]  Gandhi welcomed the decision, calling it \"the first step towards deep social reform\". [ 96 ] \n \n 2025 vote theft allegations \n Main article:  2025 Mahadevapura Electoral Controversy \n In August 2025, Gandhi alleged irregularities in voter rolls and polling processes, referring to the issue as “vote chori” (“vote theft”), during a press conference on 7 August. [ 97 ]  He cited examples from constituencies including  Mahadevapura  in Karnataka and presented documents which he said showed duplicate and fraudulent voter entries. The Election Commission of India subsequently asked him to provide formal evidence supporting the claims or to withdraw them. Later in the month, Gandhi expanded the allegations to cover multiple parliamentary constituencies and took part in public demonstrations organised by the Indian National Congress on the issue. [ 98 ] \n \n Political positions \n National security \n 68th   United States Secretary of State   John Kerry   with Gandhi at the Roosevelt House in New Delhi. \nIn December 2010, during the  United States diplomatic cables leak ,  WikiLeaks  leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009 after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the general secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the  United States ambassador to India ,  Timothy J. Roemer . In a \"candid conversation\" with Roemer, he said that he believes  Hindu extremists  pose a greater threat to his country than  Muslim  militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP). Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the  Islamist  militant organisation  Lashkar-e-Taiba  (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous  Muslim  population. [ 99 ]  In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson  Ravi Shankar Prasad  slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, \"In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in  Pakistan  and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security.\" Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. [ 100 ]  Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the  RSS  and has compared them to terrorist organisations like  SIMI . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Gandhi with Greek prime minister  George Papandreou  in  Chanakyapuri , New Delhi After the  2013 Muzaffarnagar riots  at a  Madhya Pradesh election rally  in Indore, Gandhi claimed that a police officer told him that Pakistan's military intelligence service,  ISI , was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters. [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The district administration, Uttar Pradesh state government, Union Home Ministry, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  This remark drew heavy criticism from various political outfits such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U). [ 107 ]  Congress's  Jairam Ramesh  said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for this remark. [ 108 ]  In reply to the  ECI's  show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn't intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics. [ 109 ] \n Lokpal \n Gandhi opines that the  Lokpal  should be made a  constitutional body  and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He opined that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption, rather a strong political will is needed to remove corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of  Anna Hazare 's fast. Gandhi's statement was considered a delaying tactic by the opposition and  Team Anna 's members. It was consequently slammed by opposition leaders  Sushma Swaraj  and  Arun Jaitley . [ 110 ]  The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the  Jan Lokpal Bill  report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal be made into a constitutional body.\n \n Farmers and land agitation \n  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  sits next to Gandhi who leads a delegation of leaders from  Bundelkhand  region in New Delhi. 2009 \n On 19 April 2015, Gandhi addressed the farmer and worker's rally, named as  Kisan Khet Mazdoor  Rally in  Ramlila Maidan . Here he made \"references to his agitations in  Niyamgiri  in  Orissa  and Bhatta-Parsaul in Greater Noida in  Uttar Pradesh \". [ 111 ]  The rally was attended by 100,000 people. In the speech he gave, he criticised the Indian prime minister  Narendra Modi  about his comment in  Toronto  where he said that he was \"cleaning the mess created by previous governments\". [ 112 ]  He also said, \"Do you know how Modi won the election?... He borrowed thousands of  crores  from industrialists for his several campaigns and advertisements. How will he pay them back? He will pay them back with your land. He will give your land to his industrialist friends.\" [ 111 ] \n He razzed the government as a \"suit-boot government\", a reference to Modi's monogrammed suit which he wore in the  Republic Day  meeting with  Barack Obama . Moreover, he used the \"acche din government\" jibe (which was Modi's election campaign slogan meaning \"good days government\") and mentioned that it had \"failed the country\". [ 113 ] \n A land bill was introduced by the BJP government in the parliament in May which was criticised by the opposition parties. [ 114 ]  Accusing the government of \"murdering\"  UPA 's land bill, [ 115 ]  Gandhi promised to prevent the bill from being passed, if not in the parliament then would \"stop you [  BJP  government] on streets\". He further accused the government of diluting the bill and called it \"anti-farmer\". [ 114 ]  Gandhi also drew a parallel between \"daylight robbery\" and the bill. [ 116 ]  On 26 May, the day of the Modi government's first anniversary, Gandhi commented at a rally in  Kozhikode  \"Unfortunately, birthday celebrations is only for a few powerful friends of the government. Kisan, farmers and mazdoor have nothing to celebrate.\" [ 117 ] \n \n Women's empowerment and LGBTQ rights \n .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:.5em 1.4em .8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:.5em 0 .8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5em auto .8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright span{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox>blockquote{margin:0;padding:0;border-left:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{text-align:center;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote>:first-child{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote:last-child>:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" “ \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" ” \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quote-title,.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quotebox-quote{display:block}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 .8em!important;float:none!important}} \n \n \"India will be truly successful only when women occupy equal space in our society. They must take their rightful place in politics and shape India's destiny.\"\n \n \n Gandhi's remarks on Women empowerment. [ 118 ] \n  \n Gandhi has spoken publicly about the importance of  women's empowerment  and gender equality in India. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  While inaugurating 'Utsaah', a Kerala  Mahila Congress  convention in Kochi, Gandhi stated that the Congress party would actively promote women within its organizational structure and set a target to have 50 per cent of women as chief ministers within the next 10 years. Gandhi initiated the  Self-Help Groups  amongthe women in the villages of  Amethi . [ 121 ]  The primary focus of this scheme was to bring women together and empower them with information and decision making capabilities. [ 122 ]  He has called for increased representation of women in politics and for the eradication of gender-based violence. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ]  Under the  second Manmohan Singh ministry , a  Women's Reservation Bill  to require that a third of Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats be reserved for women was introduced in the  Rajya Sabha .  \nGandhi backed the bill, stating, \"Women do not need any protection. If you give them their rights, they can protect themselves\". [ 126 ]  This bill passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010, it never received a vote in the Lok Sabha and eventually lapsed due to its pending status. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In 2019, while addressing students in  Chennai , Gandhi again called for 33 per cent reservation of all parliamentary  Lok Sabha  and state legislative assembly seats for women, as well as government jobs. [ 131 ] \n On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India revoked  Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , an act which criminalised homosexual sex between adults. Gandhi supported this move, stating that he believed that issues related to personal freedom should be left to the individual. [ 132 ]  He opined that it's essential to uphold the constitutional guarantee of life and liberty to all citizens of India. [ 133 ]  Under Gandhi's leadership, the Congress appointed a transgender woman as national general secretary in the  women’s wing —seen as a step toward mainstreaming transgender individuals. [ 134 ] \n \n Climate and energy \n Gandhi advocates the transition to renewable energy sources and has called for increased investment in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy technologies. [ 135 ]  He has been very concerned about the  environmental degradation  of the world and has said that unless environmental problems are made a political issue, they will not get the attention they deserve. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] \n Gandhi criticised the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft by calling it \"dangerous\" and said that its long term consequences will be harmful. Calling it a disaster, he said that it will silence the communities who will be directly impacted by environmental degradation. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] \n \n Economy \n Gandhi at  Stanford University  in May 2023, delivers address on India's democracy, United States relationship \n Gandhi while addressing All India Congress Committee (AICC) in  Jaipur , called for an end to  red tape  and outdated laws that slow job creation. [ 140 ] \nGandhi views the economic policies of  Modi Government  as fundamentally to benefit the 2-3 billionaires and has described them as  crony capitalists . [ 141 ]  Calling the \"crony capitalists\" as best friends of Modi, he has been critical of the privatisation of government assets. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]  He is of the view that  RSS  and crony capitalists are colluding to control India. [ 144 ]  He has been specifically harsh on Indian billionaire  Gautam Adani , to whom he said the Modi Government has been very favourable. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ]  He sees the rise of Adani as a direct consequence of crony capitalism. [ 148 ] [ 149 ]  He said that he is not anti-business and supports fairness. [ 150 ]  Disagreeing with privatisation of  PSUs , he said that Congress will not allow the privatisation if it comes to power. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ]  Citing the report on inequality by  Oxfam , he said that rising economic inequality is the result of Modi Government's economic policies. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] \n \n Demonetisation \n Gandhi has been very critical of the  Modi government 's  demonetisation  of  ₹500  and  ₹1,000  banknotes of the  Mahatma Gandhi Series . [ 157 ]  He has called it a \"tragedy\" and a \"disaster\" that has negatively impacted the Indian economy and the lives of ordinary citizens. Gandhi has also accused the government of carrying out the policy without adequate planning and causing immense hardship to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. He said that demonetisation is a fundamental failure of policy design [ 158 ]  and has alleged that it was a deliberate move by \"PayPM\" to help 2-3 billionaires to monopolise the economy. Terming demonetisation as the country's “biggest scam”, [ 159 ] \n During his public speeches and political rallies, Gandhi has consistently criticised the demonetisation move, claiming that it failed to achieve its intended objectives of combating black money and curbing corruption. [ 160 ]  He has also argued that the policy was implemented without proper consultation with experts or the  opposition parties . Gandhi further asserted that, demonetisation caused significant disruption to farmers, and rendered millions jobless in small and medium-sized businesses, and workers in the informal sector.

A member of the  Indian National Congress  (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th  leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha  and as the member of the  Lok Sabha  for  Rae Bareli ,  Uttar Pradesh , since June 2024. [ c ] [ d ]  He previously represented the constituency of  Wayanad ,  Kerala , from 2019 to 2024, and  Amethi ,  Uttar Pradesh , from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the  party president  of the  Indian National Congress  from December 2017 to July 2019.\n A member of the  Nehru–Gandhi political family , he spent his early years between  Delhi  and  Dehradun , remaining largely outside the  public sphere  during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended  The Doon School . However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at  St. Stephen's College  before moving to  Harvard University . Following his father's  assassination  and subsequent security concerns, he moved to  Rollins College  in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a  M.Phil.  from  Cambridge , Gandhi initiated his professional career with the  Monitor Group , a management consulting firm in  London . Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded a technology outsourcing firm based in  Mumbai . He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the  Indian Youth Congress  and  National Students Union of India , while also being a trustee of the  Rajiv Gandhi Foundation  and  Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust .\n Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the  Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency  in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as  Leader of the Opposition .\n \n \n Early life and background \n Further information:  Nehru–Gandhi family \n Gandhi along with  Sonia Gandhi , then  POI   Pratibha Patil , then  VPOI   Ansari , then  PM  at the memorial of his grandmother  Indira Gandhi \n Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in  Delhi . [ 12 ]  He was the first of two children born to  Rajiv Gandhi , who later served as the 6th prime minister of India, and  Sonia Gandhi , who went on to become the  president of the Indian National Congress . As the grandson of former prime minister  Indira Gandhi , his lineage is deeply rooted in Indian political history. His paternal grandfather,  Feroze Gandhi , hailed from  Gujarat  and was of  Parsi  descent. [ 13 ]  Furthermore, he is the great-grandson of India's inaugural prime minister,  Jawaharlal Nehru .\n Gandhi completed his elementary education at  St. Columba's School  in New Delhi. [ 14 ]  He then attended  The Doon School  in Dehradun (an elite all-boys' boarding school, also the alma mater of his father,  Rajiv Gandhi ) from 1981 to 1983. [ 15 ]  At Doon, Gandhi studied alongside notable contemporaries, including former Congress members  Jyotiraditya Scindia  and  Jitin Prasada . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  Following the  assassination of Indira Gandhi  by Sikhs in her personal guard on 31 October 1984, his father entered politics and became the 6th prime minister of India. Due to security threats from  Sikh extremists , Gandhi and his sister Priyanka were  home-schooled , taking examinations under the supervision of teachers. [ 18 ]  Spending their childhood away from media attention, Gandhi and  his sister  kept low profiles, appearing with their parents at a handful of public occasions. [ 19 ] \n Gandhi joined  St. Stephen's College , Delhi, an affiliated college of the  University of Delhi , in 1989 for his undergraduate education. [ 20 ]  Gandhi's academic performance in Class XII, with a score of 61 per cent in the  CBSE school certificate , was perceived as not particularly strong. [ 21 ]  He gained admission to St. Stephen's College for  BA (Honors)  History through the sports quota, which granted a 10 per cent advantage in exam scores to promising athletes; per  National Rifle Association of India  testimonials, Gandhi stood 4th in the 32nd  National Shooting Competition  held in New Delhi from 26 December 1988 to 5 January 1989. [ 21 ]  Gandhi had finished fourth in the Centre Fire Pistol 25 M (Indian Rule) Men's civilian event with a score of 371 out of 400 points. [ 21 ]  By July 1989, Gandhi had won eight national awards. In 1991, following the  assassination of Rajiv Gandhi  by the  LTTE  during an election rally, Gandhi left St. Stephen's and moved to  Harvard University . Due to security concerns, he subsequently relocated to  Rollins College  in  Florida . He further went on to obtain an  Master of Philosophy  (MPhil) in  Development Studies , from  Trinity College , Cambridge in 1995. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  Following his father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, there was a heightened threat perception to the family, those closest to Gandhi were paranoid about his safety and might have forced him to take cover under the misleading surname \"Vinci\". [ 24 ] \n After completing higher education, Gandhi worked at the  Monitor Group , a  management consulting  firm set up by  Michael Porter  of  Harvard Business School , in  London  for three years. [ 25 ]  In 2002, he returned to India and established his  technology consultancy , Backops Services Private Ltd, in  Mumbai , where he served as one of the directors of the firm. [ 26 ]  Subsequently, he founded BackOps UK, a company that secured defence contracts from foreign suppliers. [ 27 ] \n \n Political career \n Formative years \n Rahul Gandhi (right) with  Hillary Clinton ,  Sonia Gandhi , and  Karan Singh  in New Delhi, 2009 \n In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the  14th general elections  from his father's former constituency of  Amethi  in  Uttar Pradesh  for the  Lok Sabha , India's lower house of parliament. [ 28 ]  His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of  Raebareli . When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister  Priyanka Gandhi  as the more charismatic and probable successor. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous  political family  would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population. [ 29 ]  In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce  caste  and  religious  tensions. [ 30 ] \n After being out of power for a record eight years, the Congress party returned to power, winning a total of 145 seats in the 2004 Indian general election. A  coalition government  was formed at the center by Congress with the backing of regional parties. Gandhi secured a victory by a substantial margin of over 100,000 votes, thereby maintaining the stronghold of his family in Uttar Pradesh. [ 31 ]  The party performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh, as it held 10 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with a vote share of 12.53 per cent. [ 32 ]   Gandhi did not hold any official role or position within the government. [ 33 ]  From 2004 to 2006, Gandhi served as a member for the  Standing Committee  on  Home Affairs . Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the member of the Standing Committee on  Human Resource Development . [ 34 ] \n Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, managed their mother's campaign for re-election to  Raebareilly  in 2006, which was won with a margin of over 400,000 votes. [ 35 ]  He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the  2007 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election ; Congress did not perform well in those elections, winning 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53 per cent of the vote. [ 36 ]  On 24 September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as the general secretary of the  All India Congress Committee , the governing body of the Congress party, as part of a reshuffle of the party secretariat. [ 37 ]  In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the  Indian Youth Congress  and the  National Students Union of India . [ 38 ] \n For the  2009 Indian general election , Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107  constituencies . [ 39 ] [ 40 ]  His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party's vision and agenda for the country. [ 41 ]  He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women's empowerment. Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country's future. [ 42 ]   The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led  United Progressive Alliance  (UPA) government. [ 43 ]  The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats. While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties. [ 44 ]  Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes. [ 45 ]  Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] \n \n Youth politics \n In September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the  Indian Youth Congress  (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the  National Students Union of India  (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community. [ 48 ]  As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations. After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million. [ 49 ]  The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in  New Delhi  to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC's  think tank . [ 52 ]  In 2009, during Gandhi's visit to  West Bengal , the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members. [ 53 ]  Similarly, the IYC acquired around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh. After his visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions. [ 54 ] \n While serving as the general secretary of the NSUI, Gandhi played an active role in strengthening the organisation and increasing  student participation  in politics. [ 50 ]  Under his leadership, the NSUI initiated programs and campaigns to address issues affecting the student community, such as the quality of education, employment opportunities, and social justice. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  Gandhi also advocated for greater student representation in decision-making processes and supported  student leaders  in their endeavours. [ 58 ] \n \n Congress leadership \n Ahead of the  2014 Indian general election , Gandhi was named the vice-president of the Indian National Congress, effectively making him the party's second-in-command. Gandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi, [ 59 ]  and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress. [ 60 ]  Gandhi retained the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP's  Smriti Irani , by a margin of 107,000 votes. [ 47 ] [ 61 ]  The Congress party suffered a massive defeat, winning 44 seats—its worst performance ever in the Lok Sabha elections. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  The UPA also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won 59 seats, compared to the 262 seats won in 2009. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  Following the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign from his positions which was rejected by the Congress Working Committee. [ 66 ] \n Gandhi led the  2019 election campaign  of the Congress party. During  campaign, Gandhi announced \"Nyay\" (Nyuntam Aay Yojana— Minimum Income Guarantee) Scheme promising Rs 6,000 each to 20 per cent poorest households to his election speeches. [ 67 ]  Gandhi also promised to fill 22 lakhs government jobs within one year coming to power at the  Centre . Gandhi used the slogan \" Chowkidar Chor Hai \" as a jibe against Narendra Modi, BJP's prime ministerial candidate during his election rallies. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]  The slogan was aimed at Modi about the alleged irregularities and favouritism in awarding the contracts for the  Rafale fighter jet deal . [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  Post election results the INC won 52 seats, eight more than the previous election. Its vote percentage once again fell below 20 per cent. Gandhi won the Wayanad seat with over 60 per cent vote share. [ 72 ]  He lost his existing seat of Amethi to  Smriti Irani  of the BJP by a margin of 55,120 votes. [ 73 ] \n Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded political initiatives, including the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , which were designed to address pressing social and economic issues facing the country. These campaigns aimed to foster unity and counter divisive politics, while also enhancing the visibility of the Indian National Congress (INC) among voters. The INC secured 99 seats in the elections, representing an improvement from previous electoral performances and allowing the party to reclaim the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in ten years. In the elections, Gandhi successfully won the  Rae Bareli  constituency, succeeding his mother,  Sonia Gandhi . \n As a member of Parliament of India since 2004, Gandhi has served as a member of several  parliamentary committees  including  Home Affairs ,  Human Resource Development ,  External Affairs ,  Ministry of Finance  and  Corporate Affairs  and  Defence .\n \n National Herald case \n The  National Herald case  revolves around allegations of financial irregularities and misuse of funds related to the  National Herald  newspaper. The case garnered attention when former  BJP  leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders— Motilal Vora ,  Oscar Fernandes , Suman Dubey, and  Satyan Pitroda —of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald. The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to \"Associated Journals Limited\" (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper. [ 74 ]  Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around  ₹ 90 crore  (equivalent to  ₹ 202 crore or US$24 million in 2023), was not repaid. Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called \"Young India Ltd\" (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company's shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes. [ 74 ]  As per Swamy, YIL paid  ₹ 54 lakh  (equivalent to  ₹ 1.2 crore or US$140,000 in 2023) to get back ₹90 crore that Associated AJL owed to the Congress party. He also alleged that the loan given to AJL was illegal, as it had been taken from party funds. [ 74 ] \n The case went through various legal proceedings, including hearings in lower courts and the Delhi High Court. In December 2015, the  Delhi High Court  dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi and five others, ordering them to appear in person before the trial court. [ 75 ]  In 2015, the  Supreme Court of India  instructed Swamy to present arguments for expediting the trial in the high court. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were granted bail by the trial court on 19 December 2015. Subsequently, in 2016, the Supreme Court exempted all five accused individuals (including the Gandhis, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, and Suman Dubey) from personally attending court hearings, declining to dismiss the ongoing legal proceedings against them. [ 74 ]  In December 2020, the Delhi court dismissed a petition filed by then-BJP leader  Subramanian Swamy  seeking to summon Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and others as accused in the case. The court held that there was no  prima facie  evidence to suggest their involvement in any corruption conspiracy. [ 76 ]  In 2014, the  Enforcement Directorate  (ED) initiated an investigation into Swamy's complaint to determine if there were any indications of  money laundering . The investigation was closed due to technical reasons. Nonetheless, Swamy wrote to prime minister  Narendra Modi  expressing his suspicions about ED Director Ranjan Katoch. Subsequently, in 2015, Katoch was replaced, and the case was reopened. In December 2015, the  Patiala court  granted bail to the five individuals accused in the case. [ 77 ]  The Congress party objected to Swamy's complaint, calling it “ vindictive politics ”. [ 78 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Gandhi during  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n The Bharat Jodo  Yatra , which translates to \"Unify India March,\" was a campaign organised by the Congress party spanning from 2022 to 2023 with the stated primary objective of promoting national unity and solidarity across the various regions of India. It aimed to mobilise support for the INC and its ideology, emphasising themes of patriotism, cultural heritage, and development. [ 79 ]  Gandhi started the initiative on 7 September 2022 at  Kanyakumari  after paying tributes to his late father  Rajiv Gandhi ,  Swami Vivekananda , and the Tamil poet  Thiruvalluvar . [ 80 ]  The yatra saw Gandhi along with INC leaders, including members of Parliament and notable personalities, travelling across the country, addressing rallies, conducting public meetings, and interacting with citizens. Throughout the yatra, Gandhi focused on issues such as  economic development ,  social justice , and inclusive governance, aiming to strengthen the party's grassroots presence and reinvigorate its political relevance on the national stage. [ 81 ] \n The yatra concluded on 29 January 2023 with the unfurling of the  tricolour flag  at  Lal Chowk ,  Srinagar ; [ 82 ]  it lasted 137 days, covering 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) over nearly five months across 12 states and two union territories. During the yatra, the INC elected a new  party president  and also won a majority in the  2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election , the first majority the party had won by itself since 2018. In the subsequent elections in Karnataka and Telangana in 2023, the Congress party achieved a landslide victory, marked by an increase in both the party's vote share and the number of seats compared to the previous elections in the constituencies through which the march had passed. [ 83 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Attendees displaying banners at the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra gathering \n From 14 January to 20 March 2024, Gandhi led a second yatra across India from east to west, the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ; unlike the previous version, the Yatra was conducted in a hybrid mode. [ 84 ] \n \n Disqualification \n Main article:  Disqualification of Rahul Gandhi \n On 13 April 2019, during a political rally in  Kolar ,  Karnataka, India  before the  17th general election , Gandhi made a remark in Hindi, questioning, \"Why is it that all thieves, whether it be  Nirav Modi ,  Lalit Modi , or  Narendra Modi , have Modi in their names?\". [ 85 ]  A speech comparing Narendra Modi with  Fugitive Economic Offenders  such as  Nirav Modi  and  Lalit Modi . A criminal defamation case was filed by  Purnesh Modi , a  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP) MLA from  Surat West . He alleged that Gandhi had defamed all individuals with the surname Modi. On 16 July 2019, the Surat court excused Gandhi from appearing personally in court due to short notice. On 10 October, he pleaded not guilty in the Surat Court, recording his statements and responding to questions here on 24 June 2021, and again on 29 October. During these appearances, he clarified to the court that he did not intend to defame any community. [ 86 ] \n On 23 March 2023, Gandhi was convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment under charges of defamation. The day following the conviction,  Utpal Kumar Singh , the Lok Sabha  secretary general , announced that Rahul Gandhi would be disqualified as a member of parliament representing the  Wayanad  constituency, effective from 23 March, the date of his conviction. The secretary general further said that this action was taken under Section 8 of the  Representation of the People Act, 1951  (RPA), which deals with the disqualification of convicted representatives in India. [ 87 ]  Gandhi's lawyer  Abhishek Manu Singhvi  appealed at the higher court and secured a one-month stay on the sentence. [ 88 ]  On 5 August, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on Gandhi's conviction and sentence, handed down by Chief Judicial Magistrate in Surat on 23 March 2023. [ 89 ] \n The disqualification of Gandhi prompted widespread reactions and responses, from the Congress party as well as other opposition leaders and lawmakers abroad. [ 90 ]  Legal experts questioned the basis of the charge, as defamation is only actionable against individuals and not a generic class of people. [ 3 ]  The  US House of Representatives ,  Ro Khanna ,  Democrat  co-chair of the India Caucus, described the removal of Gandhi from parliament as a \"deep betrayal\" of India's \"deepest values\". [ 91 ] [ 92 ]  A spokesperson for  Germany's foreign ministry  stated that  Berlin  had \"acknowledged\" the verdict and was monitoring the subsequent steps, including the possibility of an appeal and whether the \"suspension of his mandate\" was deemed justified. [ 93 ]   US Senator   Chris Van Hollen  made a separate comment, stating that the news of the disqualification was \"alarming\". [ 94 ] \n \n Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha (2024–present) \n Following the 2024 general election, he was nominated as the leader of the opposition in  Lok Sabha , reinforcing his role as a prominent figure within the party and the opposition landscape. In his first year in the role, he made 16 speeches in the  17th Lok Sabha , and pressured the government to conduct a nationwide  caste census ; this was adopted by the government in April 2025, as announced by the  Union Railway Minister   Ashwini Vaishnaw . [ 95 ]  Gandhi welcomed the decision, calling it \"the first step towards deep social reform\". [ 96 ] \n \n 2025 vote theft allegations \n Main article:  2025 Mahadevapura Electoral Controversy \n In August 2025, Gandhi alleged irregularities in voter rolls and polling processes, referring to the issue as “vote chori” (“vote theft”), during a press conference on 7 August. [ 97 ]  He cited examples from constituencies including  Mahadevapura  in Karnataka and presented documents which he said showed duplicate and fraudulent voter entries. The Election Commission of India subsequently asked him to provide formal evidence supporting the claims or to withdraw them. Later in the month, Gandhi expanded the allegations to cover multiple parliamentary constituencies and took part in public demonstrations organised by the Indian National Congress on the issue. [ 98 ] \n \n Political positions \n National security \n 68th   United States Secretary of State   John Kerry   with Gandhi at the Roosevelt House in New Delhi. \nIn December 2010, during the  United States diplomatic cables leak ,  WikiLeaks  leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009 after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the general secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the  United States ambassador to India ,  Timothy J. Roemer . In a \"candid conversation\" with Roemer, he said that he believes  Hindu extremists  pose a greater threat to his country than  Muslim  militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP). Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the  Islamist  militant organisation  Lashkar-e-Taiba  (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous  Muslim  population. [ 99 ]  In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson  Ravi Shankar Prasad  slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, \"In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in  Pakistan  and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security.\" Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. [ 100 ]  Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the  RSS  and has compared them to terrorist organisations like  SIMI . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Gandhi with Greek prime minister  George Papandreou  in  Chanakyapuri , New Delhi After the  2013 Muzaffarnagar riots  at a  Madhya Pradesh election rally  in Indore, Gandhi claimed that a police officer told him that Pakistan's military intelligence service,  ISI , was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters. [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The district administration, Uttar Pradesh state government, Union Home Ministry, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  This remark drew heavy criticism from various political outfits such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U). [ 107 ]  Congress's  Jairam Ramesh  said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for this remark. [ 108 ]  In reply to the  ECI's  show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn't intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics. [ 109 ] \n Lokpal \n Gandhi opines that the  Lokpal  should be made a  constitutional body  and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He opined that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption, rather a strong political will is needed to remove corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of  Anna Hazare 's fast. Gandhi's statement was considered a delaying tactic by the opposition and  Team Anna 's members. It was consequently slammed by opposition leaders  Sushma Swaraj  and  Arun Jaitley . [ 110 ]  The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the  Jan Lokpal Bill  report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal be made into a constitutional body.\n \n Farmers and land agitation \n  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  sits next to Gandhi who leads a delegation of leaders from  Bundelkhand  region in New Delhi. 2009 \n On 19 April 2015, Gandhi addressed the farmer and worker's rally, named as  Kisan Khet Mazdoor  Rally in  Ramlila Maidan . Here he made \"references to his agitations in  Niyamgiri  in  Orissa  and Bhatta-Parsaul in Greater Noida in  Uttar Pradesh \". [ 111 ]  The rally was attended by 100,000 people. In the speech he gave, he criticised the Indian prime minister  Narendra Modi  about his comment in  Toronto  where he said that he was \"cleaning the mess created by previous governments\". [ 112 ]  He also said, \"Do you know how Modi won the election?... He borrowed thousands of  crores  from industrialists for his several campaigns and advertisements. How will he pay them back? He will pay them back with your land. He will give your land to his industrialist friends.\" [ 111 ] \n He razzed the government as a \"suit-boot government\", a reference to Modi's monogrammed suit which he wore in the  Republic Day  meeting with  Barack Obama . Moreover, he used the \"acche din government\" jibe (which was Modi's election campaign slogan meaning \"good days government\") and mentioned that it had \"failed the country\". [ 113 ] \n A land bill was introduced by the BJP government in the parliament in May which was criticised by the opposition parties. [ 114 ]  Accusing the government of \"murdering\"  UPA 's land bill, [ 115 ]  Gandhi promised to prevent the bill from being passed, if not in the parliament then would \"stop you [  BJP  government] on streets\". He further accused the government of diluting the bill and called it \"anti-farmer\". [ 114 ]  Gandhi also drew a parallel between \"daylight robbery\" and the bill. [ 116 ]  On 26 May, the day of the Modi government's first anniversary, Gandhi commented at a rally in  Kozhikode  \"Unfortunately, birthday celebrations is only for a few powerful friends of the government. Kisan, farmers and mazdoor have nothing to celebrate.\" [ 117 ] \n \n Women's empowerment and LGBTQ rights \n .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:.5em 1.4em .8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:.5em 0 .8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5em auto .8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright span{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox>blockquote{margin:0;padding:0;border-left:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{text-align:center;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote>:first-child{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote:last-child>:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" “ \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" ” \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quote-title,.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quotebox-quote{display:block}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 .8em!important;float:none!important}} \n \n \"India will be truly successful only when women occupy equal space in our society. They must take their rightful place in politics and shape India's destiny.\"\n \n \n Gandhi's remarks on Women empowerment. [ 118 ] \n  \n Gandhi has spoken publicly about the importance of  women's empowerment  and gender equality in India. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  While inaugurating 'Utsaah', a Kerala  Mahila Congress  convention in Kochi, Gandhi stated that the Congress party would actively promote women within its organizational structure and set a target to have 50 per cent of women as chief ministers within the next 10 years. Gandhi initiated the  Self-Help Groups  amongthe women in the villages of  Amethi . [ 121 ]  The primary focus of this scheme was to bring women together and empower them with information and decision making capabilities. [ 122 ]  He has called for increased representation of women in politics and for the eradication of gender-based violence. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ]  Under the  second Manmohan Singh ministry , a  Women's Reservation Bill  to require that a third of Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats be reserved for women was introduced in the  Rajya Sabha .  \nGandhi backed the bill, stating, \"Women do not need any protection. If you give them their rights, they can protect themselves\". [ 126 ]  This bill passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010, it never received a vote in the Lok Sabha and eventually lapsed due to its pending status. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In 2019, while addressing students in  Chennai , Gandhi again called for 33 per cent reservation of all parliamentary  Lok Sabha  and state legislative assembly seats for women, as well as government jobs. [ 131 ] \n On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India revoked  Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , an act which criminalised homosexual sex between adults. Gandhi supported this move, stating that he believed that issues related to personal freedom should be left to the individual. [ 132 ]  He opined that it's essential to uphold the constitutional guarantee of life and liberty to all citizens of India. [ 133 ]  Under Gandhi's leadership, the Congress appointed a transgender woman as national general secretary in the  women’s wing —seen as a step toward mainstreaming transgender individuals. [ 134 ] \n \n Climate and energy \n Gandhi advocates the transition to renewable energy sources and has called for increased investment in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy technologies. [ 135 ]  He has been very concerned about the  environmental degradation  of the world and has said that unless environmental problems are made a political issue, they will not get the attention they deserve. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] \n Gandhi criticised the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft by calling it \"dangerous\" and said that its long term consequences will be harmful. Calling it a disaster, he said that it will silence the communities who will be directly impacted by environmental degradation. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] \n \n Economy \n Gandhi at  Stanford University  in May 2023, delivers address on India's democracy, United States relationship \n Gandhi while addressing All India Congress Committee (AICC) in  Jaipur , called for an end to  red tape  and outdated laws that slow job creation. [ 140 ] \nGandhi views the economic policies of  Modi Government  as fundamentally to benefit the 2-3 billionaires and has described them as  crony capitalists . [ 141 ]  Calling the \"crony capitalists\" as best friends of Modi, he has been critical of the privatisation of government assets. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]  He is of the view that  RSS  and crony capitalists are colluding to control India. [ 144 ]  He has been specifically harsh on Indian billionaire  Gautam Adani , to whom he said the Modi Government has been very favourable. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ]  He sees the rise of Adani as a direct consequence of crony capitalism. [ 148 ] [ 149 ]  He said that he is not anti-business and supports fairness. [ 150 ]  Disagreeing with privatisation of  PSUs , he said that Congress will not allow the privatisation if it comes to power. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ]  Citing the report on inequality by  Oxfam , he said that rising economic inequality is the result of Modi Government's economic policies. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] \n \n Demonetisation \n Gandhi has been very critical of the  Modi government 's  demonetisation  of  ₹500  and  ₹1,000  banknotes of the  Mahatma Gandhi Series . [ 157 ]  He has called it a \"tragedy\" and a \"disaster\" that has negatively impacted the Indian economy and the lives of ordinary citizens. Gandhi has also accused the government of carrying out the policy without adequate planning and causing immense hardship to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. He said that demonetisation is a fundamental failure of policy design [ 158 ]  and has alleged that it was a deliberate move by \"PayPM\" to help 2-3 billionaires to monopolise the economy. Terming demonetisation as the country's “biggest scam”, [ 159 ] \n During his public speeches and political rallies, Gandhi has consistently criticised the demonetisation move, claiming that it failed to achieve its intended objectives of combating black money and curbing corruption. [ 160 ]  He has also argued that the policy was implemented without proper consultation with experts or the  opposition parties . Gandhi further asserted that, demonetisation caused significant disruption to farmers, and rendered millions jobless in small and medium-sized businesses, and workers in the informal sector.

A member of the  Indian National Congress  (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th  leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha  and as the member of the  Lok Sabha  for  Rae Bareli ,  Uttar Pradesh , since June 2024. [ c ] [ d ]  He previously represented the constituency of  Wayanad ,  Kerala , from 2019 to 2024, and  Amethi ,  Uttar Pradesh , from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the  party president  of the  Indian National Congress  from December 2017 to July 2019.\n A member of the  Nehru–Gandhi political family , he spent his early years between  Delhi  and  Dehradun , remaining largely outside the  public sphere  during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended  The Doon School . However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at  St. Stephen's College  before moving to  Harvard University . Following his father's  assassination  and subsequent security concerns, he moved to  Rollins College  in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a  M.Phil.  from  Cambridge , Gandhi initiated his professional career with the  Monitor Group , a management consulting firm in  London . Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded a technology outsourcing firm based in  Mumbai . He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the  Indian Youth Congress  and  National Students Union of India , while also being a trustee of the  Rajiv Gandhi Foundation  and  Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust .\n Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the  Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency  in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as  Leader of the Opposition .\n \n \n Early life and background \n Further information:  Nehru–Gandhi family \n Gandhi along with  Sonia Gandhi , then  POI   Pratibha Patil , then  VPOI   Ansari , then  PM  at the memorial of his grandmother  Indira Gandhi \n Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in  Delhi . [ 12 ]  He was the first of two children born to  Rajiv Gandhi , who later served as the 6th prime minister of India, and  Sonia Gandhi , who went on to become the  president of the Indian National Congress . As the grandson of former prime minister  Indira Gandhi , his lineage is deeply rooted in Indian political history. His paternal grandfather,  Feroze Gandhi , hailed from  Gujarat  and was of  Parsi  descent. [ 13 ]  Furthermore, he is the great-grandson of India's inaugural prime minister,  Jawaharlal Nehru .\n Gandhi completed his elementary education at  St. Columba's School  in New Delhi. [ 14 ]  He then attended  The Doon School  in Dehradun (an elite all-boys' boarding school, also the alma mater of his father,  Rajiv Gandhi ) from 1981 to 1983. [ 15 ]  At Doon, Gandhi studied alongside notable contemporaries, including former Congress members  Jyotiraditya Scindia  and  Jitin Prasada . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  Following the  assassination of Indira Gandhi  by Sikhs in her personal guard on 31 October 1984, his father entered politics and became the 6th prime minister of India. Due to security threats from  Sikh extremists , Gandhi and his sister Priyanka were  home-schooled , taking examinations under the supervision of teachers. [ 18 ]  Spending their childhood away from media attention, Gandhi and  his sister  kept low profiles, appearing with their parents at a handful of public occasions. [ 19 ] \n Gandhi joined  St. Stephen's College , Delhi, an affiliated college of the  University of Delhi , in 1989 for his undergraduate education. [ 20 ]  Gandhi's academic performance in Class XII, with a score of 61 per cent in the  CBSE school certificate , was perceived as not particularly strong. [ 21 ]  He gained admission to St. Stephen's College for  BA (Honors)  History through the sports quota, which granted a 10 per cent advantage in exam scores to promising athletes; per  National Rifle Association of India  testimonials, Gandhi stood 4th in the 32nd  National Shooting Competition  held in New Delhi from 26 December 1988 to 5 January 1989. [ 21 ]  Gandhi had finished fourth in the Centre Fire Pistol 25 M (Indian Rule) Men's civilian event with a score of 371 out of 400 points. [ 21 ]  By July 1989, Gandhi had won eight national awards. In 1991, following the  assassination of Rajiv Gandhi  by the  LTTE  during an election rally, Gandhi left St. Stephen's and moved to  Harvard University . Due to security concerns, he subsequently relocated to  Rollins College  in  Florida . He further went on to obtain an  Master of Philosophy  (MPhil) in  Development Studies , from  Trinity College , Cambridge in 1995. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  Following his father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, there was a heightened threat perception to the family, those closest to Gandhi were paranoid about his safety and might have forced him to take cover under the misleading surname \"Vinci\". [ 24 ] \n After completing higher education, Gandhi worked at the  Monitor Group , a  management consulting  firm set up by  Michael Porter  of  Harvard Business School , in  London  for three years. [ 25 ]  In 2002, he returned to India and established his  technology consultancy , Backops Services Private Ltd, in  Mumbai , where he served as one of the directors of the firm. [ 26 ]  Subsequently, he founded BackOps UK, a company that secured defence contracts from foreign suppliers. [ 27 ] \n \n Political career \n Formative years \n Rahul Gandhi (right) with  Hillary Clinton ,  Sonia Gandhi , and  Karan Singh  in New Delhi, 2009 \n In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the  14th general elections  from his father's former constituency of  Amethi  in  Uttar Pradesh  for the  Lok Sabha , India's lower house of parliament. [ 28 ]  His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of  Raebareli . When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister  Priyanka Gandhi  as the more charismatic and probable successor. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous  political family  would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population. [ 29 ]  In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce  caste  and  religious  tensions. [ 30 ] \n After being out of power for a record eight years, the Congress party returned to power, winning a total of 145 seats in the 2004 Indian general election. A  coalition government  was formed at the center by Congress with the backing of regional parties. Gandhi secured a victory by a substantial margin of over 100,000 votes, thereby maintaining the stronghold of his family in Uttar Pradesh. [ 31 ]  The party performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh, as it held 10 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with a vote share of 12.53 per cent. [ 32 ]   Gandhi did not hold any official role or position within the government. [ 33 ]  From 2004 to 2006, Gandhi served as a member for the  Standing Committee  on  Home Affairs . Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the member of the Standing Committee on  Human Resource Development . [ 34 ] \n Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, managed their mother's campaign for re-election to  Raebareilly  in 2006, which was won with a margin of over 400,000 votes. [ 35 ]  He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the  2007 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election ; Congress did not perform well in those elections, winning 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53 per cent of the vote. [ 36 ]  On 24 September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as the general secretary of the  All India Congress Committee , the governing body of the Congress party, as part of a reshuffle of the party secretariat. [ 37 ]  In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the  Indian Youth Congress  and the  National Students Union of India . [ 38 ] \n For the  2009 Indian general election , Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107  constituencies . [ 39 ] [ 40 ]  His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party's vision and agenda for the country. [ 41 ]  He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women's empowerment. Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country's future. [ 42 ]   The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led  United Progressive Alliance  (UPA) government. [ 43 ]  The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats. While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties. [ 44 ]  Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes. [ 45 ]  Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] \n \n Youth politics \n In September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the  Indian Youth Congress  (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the  National Students Union of India  (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community. [ 48 ]  As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations. After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million. [ 49 ]  The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in  New Delhi  to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC's  think tank . [ 52 ]  In 2009, during Gandhi's visit to  West Bengal , the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members. [ 53 ]  Similarly, the IYC acquired around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh. After his visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions. [ 54 ] \n While serving as the general secretary of the NSUI, Gandhi played an active role in strengthening the organisation and increasing  student participation  in politics. [ 50 ]  Under his leadership, the NSUI initiated programs and campaigns to address issues affecting the student community, such as the quality of education, employment opportunities, and social justice. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  Gandhi also advocated for greater student representation in decision-making processes and supported  student leaders  in their endeavours. [ 58 ] \n \n Congress leadership \n Ahead of the  2014 Indian general election , Gandhi was named the vice-president of the Indian National Congress, effectively making him the party's second-in-command. Gandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi, [ 59 ]  and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress. [ 60 ]  Gandhi retained the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP's  Smriti Irani , by a margin of 107,000 votes. [ 47 ] [ 61 ]  The Congress party suffered a massive defeat, winning 44 seats—its worst performance ever in the Lok Sabha elections. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  The UPA also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won 59 seats, compared to the 262 seats won in 2009. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  Following the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign from his positions which was rejected by the Congress Working Committee. [ 66 ] \n Gandhi led the  2019 election campaign  of the Congress party. During  campaign, Gandhi announced \"Nyay\" (Nyuntam Aay Yojana— Minimum Income Guarantee) Scheme promising Rs 6,000 each to 20 per cent poorest households to his election speeches. [ 67 ]  Gandhi also promised to fill 22 lakhs government jobs within one year coming to power at the  Centre . Gandhi used the slogan \" Chowkidar Chor Hai \" as a jibe against Narendra Modi, BJP's prime ministerial candidate during his election rallies. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]  The slogan was aimed at Modi about the alleged irregularities and favouritism in awarding the contracts for the  Rafale fighter jet deal . [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  Post election results the INC won 52 seats, eight more than the previous election. Its vote percentage once again fell below 20 per cent. Gandhi won the Wayanad seat with over 60 per cent vote share. [ 72 ]  He lost his existing seat of Amethi to  Smriti Irani  of the BJP by a margin of 55,120 votes. [ 73 ] \n Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded political initiatives, including the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , which were designed to address pressing social and economic issues facing the country. These campaigns aimed to foster unity and counter divisive politics, while also enhancing the visibility of the Indian National Congress (INC) among voters. The INC secured 99 seats in the elections, representing an improvement from previous electoral performances and allowing the party to reclaim the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in ten years. In the elections, Gandhi successfully won the  Rae Bareli  constituency, succeeding his mother,  Sonia Gandhi . \n As a member of Parliament of India since 2004, Gandhi has served as a member of several  parliamentary committees  including  Home Affairs ,  Human Resource Development ,  External Affairs ,  Ministry of Finance  and  Corporate Affairs  and  Defence .\n \n National Herald case \n The  National Herald case  revolves around allegations of financial irregularities and misuse of funds related to the  National Herald  newspaper. The case garnered attention when former  BJP  leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders— Motilal Vora ,  Oscar Fernandes , Suman Dubey, and  Satyan Pitroda —of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald. The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to \"Associated Journals Limited\" (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper. [ 74 ]  Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around  ₹ 90 crore  (equivalent to  ₹ 202 crore or US$24 million in 2023), was not repaid. Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called \"Young India Ltd\" (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company's shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes. [ 74 ]  As per Swamy, YIL paid  ₹ 54 lakh  (equivalent to  ₹ 1.2 crore or US$140,000 in 2023) to get back ₹90 crore that Associated AJL owed to the Congress party. He also alleged that the loan given to AJL was illegal, as it had been taken from party funds. [ 74 ] \n The case went through various legal proceedings, including hearings in lower courts and the Delhi High Court. In December 2015, the  Delhi High Court  dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi and five others, ordering them to appear in person before the trial court. [ 75 ]  In 2015, the  Supreme Court of India  instructed Swamy to present arguments for expediting the trial in the high court. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were granted bail by the trial court on 19 December 2015. Subsequently, in 2016, the Supreme Court exempted all five accused individuals (including the Gandhis, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, and Suman Dubey) from personally attending court hearings, declining to dismiss the ongoing legal proceedings against them. [ 74 ]  In December 2020, the Delhi court dismissed a petition filed by then-BJP leader  Subramanian Swamy  seeking to summon Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and others as accused in the case. The court held that there was no  prima facie  evidence to suggest their involvement in any corruption conspiracy. [ 76 ]  In 2014, the  Enforcement Directorate  (ED) initiated an investigation into Swamy's complaint to determine if there were any indications of  money laundering . The investigation was closed due to technical reasons. Nonetheless, Swamy wrote to prime minister  Narendra Modi  expressing his suspicions about ED Director Ranjan Katoch. Subsequently, in 2015, Katoch was replaced, and the case was reopened. In December 2015, the  Patiala court  granted bail to the five individuals accused in the case. [ 77 ]  The Congress party objected to Swamy's complaint, calling it “ vindictive politics ”. [ 78 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Gandhi during  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n The Bharat Jodo  Yatra , which translates to \"Unify India March,\" was a campaign organised by the Congress party spanning from 2022 to 2023 with the stated primary objective of promoting national unity and solidarity across the various regions of India. It aimed to mobilise support for the INC and its ideology, emphasising themes of patriotism, cultural heritage, and development. [ 79 ]  Gandhi started the initiative on 7 September 2022 at  Kanyakumari  after paying tributes to his late father  Rajiv Gandhi ,  Swami Vivekananda , and the Tamil poet  Thiruvalluvar . [ 80 ]  The yatra saw Gandhi along with INC leaders, including members of Parliament and notable personalities, travelling across the country, addressing rallies, conducting public meetings, and interacting with citizens. Throughout the yatra, Gandhi focused on issues such as  economic development ,  social justice , and inclusive governance, aiming to strengthen the party's grassroots presence and reinvigorate its political relevance on the national stage. [ 81 ] \n The yatra concluded on 29 January 2023 with the unfurling of the  tricolour flag  at  Lal Chowk ,  Srinagar ; [ 82 ]  it lasted 137 days, covering 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) over nearly five months across 12 states and two union territories. During the yatra, the INC elected a new  party president  and also won a majority in the  2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election , the first majority the party had won by itself since 2018. In the subsequent elections in Karnataka and Telangana in 2023, the Congress party achieved a landslide victory, marked by an increase in both the party's vote share and the number of seats compared to the previous elections in the constituencies through which the march had passed. [ 83 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Attendees displaying banners at the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra gathering \n From 14 January to 20 March 2024, Gandhi led a second yatra across India from east to west, the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ; unlike the previous version, the Yatra was conducted in a hybrid mode. [ 84 ] \n \n Disqualification \n Main article:  Disqualification of Rahul Gandhi \n On 13 April 2019, during a political rally in  Kolar ,  Karnataka, India  before the  17th general election , Gandhi made a remark in Hindi, questioning, \"Why is it that all thieves, whether it be  Nirav Modi ,  Lalit Modi , or  Narendra Modi , have Modi in their names?\". [ 85 ]  A speech comparing Narendra Modi with  Fugitive Economic Offenders  such as  Nirav Modi  and  Lalit Modi . A criminal defamation case was filed by  Purnesh Modi , a  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP) MLA from  Surat West . He alleged that Gandhi had defamed all individuals with the surname Modi. On 16 July 2019, the Surat court excused Gandhi from appearing personally in court due to short notice. On 10 October, he pleaded not guilty in the Surat Court, recording his statements and responding to questions here on 24 June 2021, and again on 29 October. During these appearances, he clarified to the court that he did not intend to defame any community. [ 86 ] \n On 23 March 2023, Gandhi was convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment under charges of defamation. The day following the conviction,  Utpal Kumar Singh , the Lok Sabha  secretary general , announced that Rahul Gandhi would be disqualified as a member of parliament representing the  Wayanad  constituency, effective from 23 March, the date of his conviction. The secretary general further said that this action was taken under Section 8 of the  Representation of the People Act, 1951  (RPA), which deals with the disqualification of convicted representatives in India. [ 87 ]  Gandhi's lawyer  Abhishek Manu Singhvi  appealed at the higher court and secured a one-month stay on the sentence. [ 88 ]  On 5 August, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on Gandhi's conviction and sentence, handed down by Chief Judicial Magistrate in Surat on 23 March 2023. [ 89 ] \n The disqualification of Gandhi prompted widespread reactions and responses, from the Congress party as well as other opposition leaders and lawmakers abroad. [ 90 ]  Legal experts questioned the basis of the charge, as defamation is only actionable against individuals and not a generic class of people. [ 3 ]  The  US House of Representatives ,  Ro Khanna ,  Democrat  co-chair of the India Caucus, described the removal of Gandhi from parliament as a \"deep betrayal\" of India's \"deepest values\". [ 91 ] [ 92 ]  A spokesperson for  Germany's foreign ministry  stated that  Berlin  had \"acknowledged\" the verdict and was monitoring the subsequent steps, including the possibility of an appeal and whether the \"suspension of his mandate\" was deemed justified. [ 93 ]   US Senator   Chris Van Hollen  made a separate comment, stating that the news of the disqualification was \"alarming\". [ 94 ] \n \n Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha (2024–present) \n Following the 2024 general election, he was nominated as the leader of the opposition in  Lok Sabha , reinforcing his role as a prominent figure within the party and the opposition landscape. In his first year in the role, he made 16 speeches in the  17th Lok Sabha , and pressured the government to conduct a nationwide  caste census ; this was adopted by the government in April 2025, as announced by the  Union Railway Minister   Ashwini Vaishnaw . [ 95 ]  Gandhi welcomed the decision, calling it \"the first step towards deep social reform\". [ 96 ] \n \n 2025 vote theft allegations \n Main article:  2025 Mahadevapura Electoral Controversy \n In August 2025, Gandhi alleged irregularities in voter rolls and polling processes, referring to the issue as “vote chori” (“vote theft”), during a press conference on 7 August. [ 97 ]  He cited examples from constituencies including  Mahadevapura  in Karnataka and presented documents which he said showed duplicate and fraudulent voter entries. The Election Commission of India subsequently asked him to provide formal evidence supporting the claims or to withdraw them. Later in the month, Gandhi expanded the allegations to cover multiple parliamentary constituencies and took part in public demonstrations organised by the Indian National Congress on the issue. [ 98 ] \n \n Political positions \n National security \n 68th   United States Secretary of State   John Kerry   with Gandhi at the Roosevelt House in New Delhi. \nIn December 2010, during the  United States diplomatic cables leak ,  WikiLeaks  leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009 after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the general secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the  United States ambassador to India ,  Timothy J. Roemer . In a \"candid conversation\" with Roemer, he said that he believes  Hindu extremists  pose a greater threat to his country than  Muslim  militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP). Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the  Islamist  militant organisation  Lashkar-e-Taiba  (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous  Muslim  population. [ 99 ]  In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson  Ravi Shankar Prasad  slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, \"In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in  Pakistan  and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security.\" Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. [ 100 ]  Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the  RSS  and has compared them to terrorist organisations like  SIMI . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Gandhi with Greek prime minister  George Papandreou  in  Chanakyapuri , New Delhi After the  2013 Muzaffarnagar riots  at a  Madhya Pradesh election rally  in Indore, Gandhi claimed that a police officer told him that Pakistan's military intelligence service,  ISI , was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters. [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The district administration, Uttar Pradesh state government, Union Home Ministry, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  This remark drew heavy criticism from various political outfits such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U). [ 107 ]  Congress's  Jairam Ramesh  said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for this remark. [ 108 ]  In reply to the  ECI's  show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn't intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics. [ 109 ] \n Lokpal \n Gandhi opines that the  Lokpal  should be made a  constitutional body  and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He opined that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption, rather a strong political will is needed to remove corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of  Anna Hazare 's fast. Gandhi's statement was considered a delaying tactic by the opposition and  Team Anna 's members. It was consequently slammed by opposition leaders  Sushma Swaraj  and  Arun Jaitley . [ 110 ]  The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the  Jan Lokpal Bill  report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal be made into a constitutional body.\n \n Farmers and land agitation \n  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  sits next to Gandhi who leads a delegation of leaders from  Bundelkhand  region in New Delhi. 2009 \n On 19 April 2015, Gandhi addressed the farmer and worker's rally, named as  Kisan Khet Mazdoor  Rally in  Ramlila Maidan . Here he made \"references to his agitations in  Niyamgiri  in  Orissa  and Bhatta-Parsaul in Greater Noida in  Uttar Pradesh \". [ 111 ]  The rally was attended by 100,000 people. In the speech he gave, he criticised the Indian prime minister  Narendra Modi  about his comment in  Toronto  where he said that he was \"cleaning the mess created by previous governments\". [ 112 ]  He also said, \"Do you know how Modi won the election?... He borrowed thousands of  crores  from industrialists for his several campaigns and advertisements. How will he pay them back? He will pay them back with your land. He will give your land to his industrialist friends.\" [ 111 ] \n He razzed the government as a \"suit-boot government\", a reference to Modi's monogrammed suit which he wore in the  Republic Day  meeting with  Barack Obama . Moreover, he used the \"acche din government\" jibe (which was Modi's election campaign slogan meaning \"good days government\") and mentioned that it had \"failed the country\". [ 113 ] \n A land bill was introduced by the BJP government in the parliament in May which was criticised by the opposition parties. [ 114 ]  Accusing the government of \"murdering\"  UPA 's land bill, [ 115 ]  Gandhi promised to prevent the bill from being passed, if not in the parliament then would \"stop you [  BJP  government] on streets\". He further accused the government of diluting the bill and called it \"anti-farmer\". [ 114 ]  Gandhi also drew a parallel between \"daylight robbery\" and the bill. [ 116 ]  On 26 May, the day of the Modi government's first anniversary, Gandhi commented at a rally in  Kozhikode  \"Unfortunately, birthday celebrations is only for a few powerful friends of the government. Kisan, farmers and mazdoor have nothing to celebrate.\" [ 117 ] \n \n Women's empowerment and LGBTQ rights \n .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:.5em 1.4em .8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:.5em 0 .8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5em auto .8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright span{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox>blockquote{margin:0;padding:0;border-left:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{text-align:center;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote>:first-child{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote:last-child>:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" “ \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" ” \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quote-title,.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quotebox-quote{display:block}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 .8em!important;float:none!important}} \n \n \"India will be truly successful only when women occupy equal space in our society. They must take their rightful place in politics and shape India's destiny.\"\n \n \n Gandhi's remarks on Women empowerment. [ 118 ] \n  \n Gandhi has spoken publicly about the importance of  women's empowerment  and gender equality in India. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  While inaugurating 'Utsaah', a Kerala  Mahila Congress  convention in Kochi, Gandhi stated that the Congress party would actively promote women within its organizational structure and set a target to have 50 per cent of women as chief ministers within the next 10 years. Gandhi initiated the  Self-Help Groups  amongthe women in the villages of  Amethi . [ 121 ]  The primary focus of this scheme was to bring women together and empower them with information and decision making capabilities. [ 122 ]  He has called for increased representation of women in politics and for the eradication of gender-based violence. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ]  Under the  second Manmohan Singh ministry , a  Women's Reservation Bill  to require that a third of Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats be reserved for women was introduced in the  Rajya Sabha .  \nGandhi backed the bill, stating, \"Women do not need any protection. If you give them their rights, they can protect themselves\". [ 126 ]  This bill passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010, it never received a vote in the Lok Sabha and eventually lapsed due to its pending status. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In 2019, while addressing students in  Chennai , Gandhi again called for 33 per cent reservation of all parliamentary  Lok Sabha  and state legislative assembly seats for women, as well as government jobs. [ 131 ] \n On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India revoked  Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , an act which criminalised homosexual sex between adults. Gandhi supported this move, stating that he believed that issues related to personal freedom should be left to the individual. [ 132 ]  He opined that it's essential to uphold the constitutional guarantee of life and liberty to all citizens of India. [ 133 ]  Under Gandhi's leadership, the Congress appointed a transgender woman as national general secretary in the  women’s wing —seen as a step toward mainstreaming transgender individuals. [ 134 ] \n \n Climate and energy \n Gandhi advocates the transition to renewable energy sources and has called for increased investment in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy technologies. [ 135 ]  He has been very concerned about the  environmental degradation  of the world and has said that unless environmental problems are made a political issue, they will not get the attention they deserve. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] \n Gandhi criticised the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft by calling it \"dangerous\" and said that its long term consequences will be harmful. Calling it a disaster, he said that it will silence the communities who will be directly impacted by environmental degradation. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] \n \n Economy \n Gandhi at  Stanford University  in May 2023, delivers address on India's democracy, United States relationship \n Gandhi while addressing All India Congress Committee (AICC) in  Jaipur , called for an end to  red tape  and outdated laws that slow job creation. [ 140 ] \nGandhi views the economic policies of  Modi Government  as fundamentally to benefit the 2-3 billionaires and has described them as  crony capitalists . [ 141 ]  Calling the \"crony capitalists\" as best friends of Modi, he has been critical of the privatisation of government assets. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]  He is of the view that  RSS  and crony capitalists are colluding to control India. [ 144 ]  He has been specifically harsh on Indian billionaire  Gautam Adani , to whom he said the Modi Government has been very favourable. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ]  He sees the rise of Adani as a direct consequence of crony capitalism. [ 148 ] [ 149 ]  He said that he is not anti-business and supports fairness. [ 150 ]  Disagreeing with privatisation of  PSUs , he said that Congress will not allow the privatisation if it comes to power. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ]  Citing the report on inequality by  Oxfam , he said that rising economic inequality is the result of Modi Government's economic policies. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] \n \n Demonetisation \n Gandhi has been very critical of the  Modi government 's  demonetisation  of  ₹500  and  ₹1,000  banknotes of the  Mahatma Gandhi Series . [ 157 ]  He has called it a \"tragedy\" and a \"disaster\" that has negatively impacted the Indian economy and the lives of ordinary citizens. Gandhi has also accused the government of carrying out the policy without adequate planning and causing immense hardship to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. He said that demonetisation is a fundamental failure of policy design [ 158 ]  and has alleged that it was a deliberate move by \"PayPM\" to help 2-3 billionaires to monopolise the economy. Terming demonetisation as the country's “biggest scam”, [ 159 ] \n During his public speeches and political rallies, Gandhi has consistently criticised the demonetisation move, claiming that it failed to achieve its intended objectives of combating black money and curbing corruption. [ 160 ]  He has also argued that the policy was implemented without proper consultation with experts or the  opposition parties . Gandhi further asserted that, demonetisation caused significant disruption to farmers, and rendered millions jobless in small and medium-sized businesses, and workers in the informal sector.

A member of the  Indian National Congress  (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th  leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha  and as the member of the  Lok Sabha  for  Rae Bareli ,  Uttar Pradesh , since June 2024. [ c ] [ d ]  He previously represented the constituency of  Wayanad ,  Kerala , from 2019 to 2024, and  Amethi ,  Uttar Pradesh , from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the  party president  of the  Indian National Congress  from December 2017 to July 2019.\n A member of the  Nehru–Gandhi political family , he spent his early years between  Delhi  and  Dehradun , remaining largely outside the  public sphere  during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended  The Doon School . However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at  St. Stephen's College  before moving to  Harvard University . Following his father's  assassination  and subsequent security concerns, he moved to  Rollins College  in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a  M.Phil.  from  Cambridge , Gandhi initiated his professional career with the  Monitor Group , a management consulting firm in  London . Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded a technology outsourcing firm based in  Mumbai . He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the  Indian Youth Congress  and  National Students Union of India , while also being a trustee of the  Rajiv Gandhi Foundation  and  Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust .\n Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the  Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency  in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as  Leader of the Opposition .\n \n \n Early life and background \n Further information:  Nehru–Gandhi family \n Gandhi along with  Sonia Gandhi , then  POI   Pratibha Patil , then  VPOI   Ansari , then  PM  at the memorial of his grandmother  Indira Gandhi \n Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in  Delhi . [ 12 ]  He was the first of two children born to  Rajiv Gandhi , who later served as the 6th prime minister of India, and  Sonia Gandhi , who went on to become the  president of the Indian National Congress . As the grandson of former prime minister  Indira Gandhi , his lineage is deeply rooted in Indian political history. His paternal grandfather,  Feroze Gandhi , hailed from  Gujarat  and was of  Parsi  descent. [ 13 ]  Furthermore, he is the great-grandson of India's inaugural prime minister,  Jawaharlal Nehru .\n Gandhi completed his elementary education at  St. Columba's School  in New Delhi. [ 14 ]  He then attended  The Doon School  in Dehradun (an elite all-boys' boarding school, also the alma mater of his father,  Rajiv Gandhi ) from 1981 to 1983. [ 15 ]  At Doon, Gandhi studied alongside notable contemporaries, including former Congress members  Jyotiraditya Scindia  and  Jitin Prasada . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  Following the  assassination of Indira Gandhi  by Sikhs in her personal guard on 31 October 1984, his father entered politics and became the 6th prime minister of India. Due to security threats from  Sikh extremists , Gandhi and his sister Priyanka were  home-schooled , taking examinations under the supervision of teachers. [ 18 ]  Spending their childhood away from media attention, Gandhi and  his sister  kept low profiles, appearing with their parents at a handful of public occasions. [ 19 ] \n Gandhi joined  St. Stephen's College , Delhi, an affiliated college of the  University of Delhi , in 1989 for his undergraduate education. [ 20 ]  Gandhi's academic performance in Class XII, with a score of 61 per cent in the  CBSE school certificate , was perceived as not particularly strong. [ 21 ]  He gained admission to St. Stephen's College for  BA (Honors)  History through the sports quota, which granted a 10 per cent advantage in exam scores to promising athletes; per  National Rifle Association of India  testimonials, Gandhi stood 4th in the 32nd  National Shooting Competition  held in New Delhi from 26 December 1988 to 5 January 1989. [ 21 ]  Gandhi had finished fourth in the Centre Fire Pistol 25 M (Indian Rule) Men's civilian event with a score of 371 out of 400 points. [ 21 ]  By July 1989, Gandhi had won eight national awards. In 1991, following the  assassination of Rajiv Gandhi  by the  LTTE  during an election rally, Gandhi left St. Stephen's and moved to  Harvard University . Due to security concerns, he subsequently relocated to  Rollins College  in  Florida . He further went on to obtain an  Master of Philosophy  (MPhil) in  Development Studies , from  Trinity College , Cambridge in 1995. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  Following his father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, there was a heightened threat perception to the family, those closest to Gandhi were paranoid about his safety and might have forced him to take cover under the misleading surname \"Vinci\". [ 24 ] \n After completing higher education, Gandhi worked at the  Monitor Group , a  management consulting  firm set up by  Michael Porter  of  Harvard Business School , in  London  for three years. [ 25 ]  In 2002, he returned to India and established his  technology consultancy , Backops Services Private Ltd, in  Mumbai , where he served as one of the directors of the firm. [ 26 ]  Subsequently, he founded BackOps UK, a company that secured defence contracts from foreign suppliers. [ 27 ] \n \n Political career \n Formative years \n Rahul Gandhi (right) with  Hillary Clinton ,  Sonia Gandhi , and  Karan Singh  in New Delhi, 2009 \n In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the  14th general elections  from his father's former constituency of  Amethi  in  Uttar Pradesh  for the  Lok Sabha , India's lower house of parliament. [ 28 ]  His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of  Raebareli . When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister  Priyanka Gandhi  as the more charismatic and probable successor. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous  political family  would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population. [ 29 ]  In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce  caste  and  religious  tensions. [ 30 ] \n After being out of power for a record eight years, the Congress party returned to power, winning a total of 145 seats in the 2004 Indian general election. A  coalition government  was formed at the center by Congress with the backing of regional parties. Gandhi secured a victory by a substantial margin of over 100,000 votes, thereby maintaining the stronghold of his family in Uttar Pradesh. [ 31 ]  The party performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh, as it held 10 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with a vote share of 12.53 per cent. [ 32 ]   Gandhi did not hold any official role or position within the government. [ 33 ]  From 2004 to 2006, Gandhi served as a member for the  Standing Committee  on  Home Affairs . Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the member of the Standing Committee on  Human Resource Development . [ 34 ] \n Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, managed their mother's campaign for re-election to  Raebareilly  in 2006, which was won with a margin of over 400,000 votes. [ 35 ]  He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the  2007 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election ; Congress did not perform well in those elections, winning 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53 per cent of the vote. [ 36 ]  On 24 September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as the general secretary of the  All India Congress Committee , the governing body of the Congress party, as part of a reshuffle of the party secretariat. [ 37 ]  In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the  Indian Youth Congress  and the  National Students Union of India . [ 38 ] \n For the  2009 Indian general election , Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107  constituencies . [ 39 ] [ 40 ]  His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party's vision and agenda for the country. [ 41 ]  He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women's empowerment. Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country's future. [ 42 ]   The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led  United Progressive Alliance  (UPA) government. [ 43 ]  The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats. While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties. [ 44 ]  Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes. [ 45 ]  Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] \n \n Youth politics \n In September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the  Indian Youth Congress  (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the  National Students Union of India  (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community. [ 48 ]  As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations. After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million. [ 49 ]  The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in  New Delhi  to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC's  think tank . [ 52 ]  In 2009, during Gandhi's visit to  West Bengal , the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members. [ 53 ]  Similarly, the IYC acquired around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh. After his visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions. [ 54 ] \n While serving as the general secretary of the NSUI, Gandhi played an active role in strengthening the organisation and increasing  student participation  in politics. [ 50 ]  Under his leadership, the NSUI initiated programs and campaigns to address issues affecting the student community, such as the quality of education, employment opportunities, and social justice. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  Gandhi also advocated for greater student representation in decision-making processes and supported  student leaders  in their endeavours. [ 58 ] \n \n Congress leadership \n Ahead of the  2014 Indian general election , Gandhi was named the vice-president of the Indian National Congress, effectively making him the party's second-in-command. Gandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi, [ 59 ]  and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress. [ 60 ]  Gandhi retained the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP's  Smriti Irani , by a margin of 107,000 votes. [ 47 ] [ 61 ]  The Congress party suffered a massive defeat, winning 44 seats—its worst performance ever in the Lok Sabha elections. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  The UPA also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won 59 seats, compared to the 262 seats won in 2009. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  Following the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign from his positions which was rejected by the Congress Working Committee. [ 66 ] \n Gandhi led the  2019 election campaign  of the Congress party. During  campaign, Gandhi announced \"Nyay\" (Nyuntam Aay Yojana— Minimum Income Guarantee) Scheme promising Rs 6,000 each to 20 per cent poorest households to his election speeches. [ 67 ]  Gandhi also promised to fill 22 lakhs government jobs within one year coming to power at the  Centre . Gandhi used the slogan \" Chowkidar Chor Hai \" as a jibe against Narendra Modi, BJP's prime ministerial candidate during his election rallies. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]  The slogan was aimed at Modi about the alleged irregularities and favouritism in awarding the contracts for the  Rafale fighter jet deal . [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  Post election results the INC won 52 seats, eight more than the previous election. Its vote percentage once again fell below 20 per cent. Gandhi won the Wayanad seat with over 60 per cent vote share. [ 72 ]  He lost his existing seat of Amethi to  Smriti Irani  of the BJP by a margin of 55,120 votes. [ 73 ] \n Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded political initiatives, including the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , which were designed to address pressing social and economic issues facing the country. These campaigns aimed to foster unity and counter divisive politics, while also enhancing the visibility of the Indian National Congress (INC) among voters. The INC secured 99 seats in the elections, representing an improvement from previous electoral performances and allowing the party to reclaim the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in ten years. In the elections, Gandhi successfully won the  Rae Bareli  constituency, succeeding his mother,  Sonia Gandhi . \n As a member of Parliament of India since 2004, Gandhi has served as a member of several  parliamentary committees  including  Home Affairs ,  Human Resource Development ,  External Affairs ,  Ministry of Finance  and  Corporate Affairs  and  Defence .\n \n National Herald case \n The  National Herald case  revolves around allegations of financial irregularities and misuse of funds related to the  National Herald  newspaper. The case garnered attention when former  BJP  leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders— Motilal Vora ,  Oscar Fernandes , Suman Dubey, and  Satyan Pitroda —of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald. The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to \"Associated Journals Limited\" (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper. [ 74 ]  Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around  ₹ 90 crore  (equivalent to  ₹ 202 crore or US$24 million in 2023), was not repaid. Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called \"Young India Ltd\" (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company's shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes. [ 74 ]  As per Swamy, YIL paid  ₹ 54 lakh  (equivalent to  ₹ 1.2 crore or US$140,000 in 2023) to get back ₹90 crore that Associated AJL owed to the Congress party. He also alleged that the loan given to AJL was illegal, as it had been taken from party funds. [ 74 ] \n The case went through various legal proceedings, including hearings in lower courts and the Delhi High Court. In December 2015, the  Delhi High Court  dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi and five others, ordering them to appear in person before the trial court. [ 75 ]  In 2015, the  Supreme Court of India  instructed Swamy to present arguments for expediting the trial in the high court. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were granted bail by the trial court on 19 December 2015. Subsequently, in 2016, the Supreme Court exempted all five accused individuals (including the Gandhis, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, and Suman Dubey) from personally attending court hearings, declining to dismiss the ongoing legal proceedings against them. [ 74 ]  In December 2020, the Delhi court dismissed a petition filed by then-BJP leader  Subramanian Swamy  seeking to summon Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and others as accused in the case. The court held that there was no  prima facie  evidence to suggest their involvement in any corruption conspiracy. [ 76 ]  In 2014, the  Enforcement Directorate  (ED) initiated an investigation into Swamy's complaint to determine if there were any indications of  money laundering . The investigation was closed due to technical reasons. Nonetheless, Swamy wrote to prime minister  Narendra Modi  expressing his suspicions about ED Director Ranjan Katoch. Subsequently, in 2015, Katoch was replaced, and the case was reopened. In December 2015, the  Patiala court  granted bail to the five individuals accused in the case. [ 77 ]  The Congress party objected to Swamy's complaint, calling it “ vindictive politics ”. [ 78 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Gandhi during  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n The Bharat Jodo  Yatra , which translates to \"Unify India March,\" was a campaign organised by the Congress party spanning from 2022 to 2023 with the stated primary objective of promoting national unity and solidarity across the various regions of India. It aimed to mobilise support for the INC and its ideology, emphasising themes of patriotism, cultural heritage, and development. [ 79 ]  Gandhi started the initiative on 7 September 2022 at  Kanyakumari  after paying tributes to his late father  Rajiv Gandhi ,  Swami Vivekananda , and the Tamil poet  Thiruvalluvar . [ 80 ]  The yatra saw Gandhi along with INC leaders, including members of Parliament and notable personalities, travelling across the country, addressing rallies, conducting public meetings, and interacting with citizens. Throughout the yatra, Gandhi focused on issues such as  economic development ,  social justice , and inclusive governance, aiming to strengthen the party's grassroots presence and reinvigorate its political relevance on the national stage. [ 81 ] \n The yatra concluded on 29 January 2023 with the unfurling of the  tricolour flag  at  Lal Chowk ,  Srinagar ; [ 82 ]  it lasted 137 days, covering 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) over nearly five months across 12 states and two union territories. During the yatra, the INC elected a new  party president  and also won a majority in the  2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election , the first majority the party had won by itself since 2018. In the subsequent elections in Karnataka and Telangana in 2023, the Congress party achieved a landslide victory, marked by an increase in both the party's vote share and the number of seats compared to the previous elections in the constituencies through which the march had passed. [ 83 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Attendees displaying banners at the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra gathering \n From 14 January to 20 March 2024, Gandhi led a second yatra across India from east to west, the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ; unlike the previous version, the Yatra was conducted in a hybrid mode. [ 84 ] \n \n Disqualification \n Main article:  Disqualification of Rahul Gandhi \n On 13 April 2019, during a political rally in  Kolar ,  Karnataka, India  before the  17th general election , Gandhi made a remark in Hindi, questioning, \"Why is it that all thieves, whether it be  Nirav Modi ,  Lalit Modi , or  Narendra Modi , have Modi in their names?\". [ 85 ]  A speech comparing Narendra Modi with  Fugitive Economic Offenders  such as  Nirav Modi  and  Lalit Modi . A criminal defamation case was filed by  Purnesh Modi , a  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP) MLA from  Surat West . He alleged that Gandhi had defamed all individuals with the surname Modi. On 16 July 2019, the Surat court excused Gandhi from appearing personally in court due to short notice. On 10 October, he pleaded not guilty in the Surat Court, recording his statements and responding to questions here on 24 June 2021, and again on 29 October. During these appearances, he clarified to the court that he did not intend to defame any community. [ 86 ] \n On 23 March 2023, Gandhi was convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment under charges of defamation. The day following the conviction,  Utpal Kumar Singh , the Lok Sabha  secretary general , announced that Rahul Gandhi would be disqualified as a member of parliament representing the  Wayanad  constituency, effective from 23 March, the date of his conviction. The secretary general further said that this action was taken under Section 8 of the  Representation of the People Act, 1951  (RPA), which deals with the disqualification of convicted representatives in India. [ 87 ]  Gandhi's lawyer  Abhishek Manu Singhvi  appealed at the higher court and secured a one-month stay on the sentence. [ 88 ]  On 5 August, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on Gandhi's conviction and sentence, handed down by Chief Judicial Magistrate in Surat on 23 March 2023. [ 89 ] \n The disqualification of Gandhi prompted widespread reactions and responses, from the Congress party as well as other opposition leaders and lawmakers abroad. [ 90 ]  Legal experts questioned the basis of the charge, as defamation is only actionable against individuals and not a generic class of people. [ 3 ]  The  US House of Representatives ,  Ro Khanna ,  Democrat  co-chair of the India Caucus, described the removal of Gandhi from parliament as a \"deep betrayal\" of India's \"deepest values\". [ 91 ] [ 92 ]  A spokesperson for  Germany's foreign ministry  stated that  Berlin  had \"acknowledged\" the verdict and was monitoring the subsequent steps, including the possibility of an appeal and whether the \"suspension of his mandate\" was deemed justified. [ 93 ]   US Senator   Chris Van Hollen  made a separate comment, stating that the news of the disqualification was \"alarming\". [ 94 ] \n \n Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha (2024–present) \n Following the 2024 general election, he was nominated as the leader of the opposition in  Lok Sabha , reinforcing his role as a prominent figure within the party and the opposition landscape. In his first year in the role, he made 16 speeches in the  17th Lok Sabha , and pressured the government to conduct a nationwide  caste census ; this was adopted by the government in April 2025, as announced by the  Union Railway Minister   Ashwini Vaishnaw . [ 95 ]  Gandhi welcomed the decision, calling it \"the first step towards deep social reform\". [ 96 ] \n \n 2025 vote theft allegations \n Main article:  2025 Mahadevapura Electoral Controversy \n In August 2025, Gandhi alleged irregularities in voter rolls and polling processes, referring to the issue as “vote chori” (“vote theft”), during a press conference on 7 August. [ 97 ]  He cited examples from constituencies including  Mahadevapura  in Karnataka and presented documents which he said showed duplicate and fraudulent voter entries. The Election Commission of India subsequently asked him to provide formal evidence supporting the claims or to withdraw them. Later in the month, Gandhi expanded the allegations to cover multiple parliamentary constituencies and took part in public demonstrations organised by the Indian National Congress on the issue. [ 98 ] \n \n Political positions \n National security \n 68th   United States Secretary of State   John Kerry   with Gandhi at the Roosevelt House in New Delhi. \nIn December 2010, during the  United States diplomatic cables leak ,  WikiLeaks  leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009 after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the general secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the  United States ambassador to India ,  Timothy J. Roemer . In a \"candid conversation\" with Roemer, he said that he believes  Hindu extremists  pose a greater threat to his country than  Muslim  militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP). Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the  Islamist  militant organisation  Lashkar-e-Taiba  (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous  Muslim  population. [ 99 ]  In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson  Ravi Shankar Prasad  slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, \"In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in  Pakistan  and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security.\" Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. [ 100 ]  Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the  RSS  and has compared them to terrorist organisations like  SIMI . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Gandhi with Greek prime minister  George Papandreou  in  Chanakyapuri , New Delhi After the  2013 Muzaffarnagar riots  at a  Madhya Pradesh election rally  in Indore, Gandhi claimed that a police officer told him that Pakistan's military intelligence service,  ISI , was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters. [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The district administration, Uttar Pradesh state government, Union Home Ministry, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  This remark drew heavy criticism from various political outfits such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U). [ 107 ]  Congress's  Jairam Ramesh  said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for this remark. [ 108 ]  In reply to the  ECI's  show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn't intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics. [ 109 ] \n Lokpal \n Gandhi opines that the  Lokpal  should be made a  constitutional body  and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He opined that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption, rather a strong political will is needed to remove corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of  Anna Hazare 's fast. Gandhi's statement was considered a delaying tactic by the opposition and  Team Anna 's members. It was consequently slammed by opposition leaders  Sushma Swaraj  and  Arun Jaitley . [ 110 ]  The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the  Jan Lokpal Bill  report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal be made into a constitutional body.\n \n Farmers and land agitation \n  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  sits next to Gandhi who leads a delegation of leaders from  Bundelkhand  region in New Delhi. 2009 \n On 19 April 2015, Gandhi addressed the farmer and worker's rally, named as  Kisan Khet Mazdoor  Rally in  Ramlila Maidan . Here he made \"references to his agitations in  Niyamgiri  in  Orissa  and Bhatta-Parsaul in Greater Noida in  Uttar Pradesh \". [ 111 ]  The rally was attended by 100,000 people. In the speech he gave, he criticised the Indian prime minister  Narendra Modi  about his comment in  Toronto  where he said that he was \"cleaning the mess created by previous governments\". [ 112 ]  He also said, \"Do you know how Modi won the election?... He borrowed thousands of  crores  from industrialists for his several campaigns and advertisements. How will he pay them back? He will pay them back with your land. He will give your land to his industrialist friends.\" [ 111 ] \n He razzed the government as a \"suit-boot government\", a reference to Modi's monogrammed suit which he wore in the  Republic Day  meeting with  Barack Obama . Moreover, he used the \"acche din government\" jibe (which was Modi's election campaign slogan meaning \"good days government\") and mentioned that it had \"failed the country\". [ 113 ] \n A land bill was introduced by the BJP government in the parliament in May which was criticised by the opposition parties. [ 114 ]  Accusing the government of \"murdering\"  UPA 's land bill, [ 115 ]  Gandhi promised to prevent the bill from being passed, if not in the parliament then would \"stop you [  BJP  government] on streets\". He further accused the government of diluting the bill and called it \"anti-farmer\". [ 114 ]  Gandhi also drew a parallel between \"daylight robbery\" and the bill. [ 116 ]  On 26 May, the day of the Modi government's first anniversary, Gandhi commented at a rally in  Kozhikode  \"Unfortunately, birthday celebrations is only for a few powerful friends of the government. Kisan, farmers and mazdoor have nothing to celebrate.\" [ 117 ] \n \n Women's empowerment and LGBTQ rights \n .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:.5em 1.4em .8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:.5em 0 .8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5em auto .8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright span{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox>blockquote{margin:0;padding:0;border-left:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{text-align:center;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote>:first-child{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote:last-child>:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" “ \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" ” \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quote-title,.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quotebox-quote{display:block}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 .8em!important;float:none!important}} \n \n \"India will be truly successful only when women occupy equal space in our society. They must take their rightful place in politics and shape India's destiny.\"\n \n \n Gandhi's remarks on Women empowerment. [ 118 ] \n  \n Gandhi has spoken publicly about the importance of  women's empowerment  and gender equality in India. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  While inaugurating 'Utsaah', a Kerala  Mahila Congress  convention in Kochi, Gandhi stated that the Congress party would actively promote women within its organizational structure and set a target to have 50 per cent of women as chief ministers within the next 10 years. Gandhi initiated the  Self-Help Groups  amongthe women in the villages of  Amethi . [ 121 ]  The primary focus of this scheme was to bring women together and empower them with information and decision making capabilities. [ 122 ]  He has called for increased representation of women in politics and for the eradication of gender-based violence. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ]  Under the  second Manmohan Singh ministry , a  Women's Reservation Bill  to require that a third of Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats be reserved for women was introduced in the  Rajya Sabha .  \nGandhi backed the bill, stating, \"Women do not need any protection. If you give them their rights, they can protect themselves\". [ 126 ]  This bill passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010, it never received a vote in the Lok Sabha and eventually lapsed due to its pending status. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In 2019, while addressing students in  Chennai , Gandhi again called for 33 per cent reservation of all parliamentary  Lok Sabha  and state legislative assembly seats for women, as well as government jobs. [ 131 ] \n On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India revoked  Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , an act which criminalised homosexual sex between adults. Gandhi supported this move, stating that he believed that issues related to personal freedom should be left to the individual. [ 132 ]  He opined that it's essential to uphold the constitutional guarantee of life and liberty to all citizens of India. [ 133 ]  Under Gandhi's leadership, the Congress appointed a transgender woman as national general secretary in the  women’s wing —seen as a step toward mainstreaming transgender individuals. [ 134 ] \n \n Climate and energy \n Gandhi advocates the transition to renewable energy sources and has called for increased investment in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy technologies. [ 135 ]  He has been very concerned about the  environmental degradation  of the world and has said that unless environmental problems are made a political issue, they will not get the attention they deserve. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] \n Gandhi criticised the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft by calling it \"dangerous\" and said that its long term consequences will be harmful. Calling it a disaster, he said that it will silence the communities who will be directly impacted by environmental degradation. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] \n \n Economy \n Gandhi at  Stanford University  in May 2023, delivers address on India's democracy, United States relationship \n Gandhi while addressing All India Congress Committee (AICC) in  Jaipur , called for an end to  red tape  and outdated laws that slow job creation. [ 140 ] \nGandhi views the economic policies of  Modi Government  as fundamentally to benefit the 2-3 billionaires and has described them as  crony capitalists . [ 141 ]  Calling the \"crony capitalists\" as best friends of Modi, he has been critical of the privatisation of government assets. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]  He is of the view that  RSS  and crony capitalists are colluding to control India. [ 144 ]  He has been specifically harsh on Indian billionaire  Gautam Adani , to whom he said the Modi Government has been very favourable. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ]  He sees the rise of Adani as a direct consequence of crony capitalism. [ 148 ] [ 149 ]  He said that he is not anti-business and supports fairness. [ 150 ]  Disagreeing with privatisation of  PSUs , he said that Congress will not allow the privatisation if it comes to power. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ]  Citing the report on inequality by  Oxfam , he said that rising economic inequality is the result of Modi Government's economic policies. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] \n \n Demonetisation \n Gandhi has been very critical of the  Modi government 's  demonetisation  of  ₹500  and  ₹1,000  banknotes of the  Mahatma Gandhi Series . [ 157 ]  He has called it a \"tragedy\" and a \"disaster\" that has negatively impacted the Indian economy and the lives of ordinary citizens. Gandhi has also accused the government of carrying out the policy without adequate planning and causing immense hardship to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. He said that demonetisation is a fundamental failure of policy design [ 158 ]  and has alleged that it was a deliberate move by \"PayPM\" to help 2-3 billionaires to monopolise the economy. Terming demonetisation as the country's “biggest scam”, [ 159 ] \n During his public speeches and political rallies, Gandhi has consistently criticised the demonetisation move, claiming that it failed to achieve its intended objectives of combating black money and curbing corruption. [ 160 ]  He has also argued that the policy was implemented without proper consultation with experts or the  opposition parties . Gandhi further asserted that, demonetisation caused significant disruption to farmers, and rendered millions jobless in small and medium-sized businesses, and workers in the informal sector.

A member of the  Indian National Congress  (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th  leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha  and as the member of the  Lok Sabha  for  Rae Bareli ,  Uttar Pradesh , since June 2024. [ c ] [ d ]  He previously represented the constituency of  Wayanad ,  Kerala , from 2019 to 2024, and  Amethi ,  Uttar Pradesh , from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the  party president  of the  Indian National Congress  from December 2017 to July 2019.\n A member of the  Nehru–Gandhi political family , he spent his early years between  Delhi  and  Dehradun , remaining largely outside the  public sphere  during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended  The Doon School . However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at  St. Stephen's College  before moving to  Harvard University . Following his father's  assassination  and subsequent security concerns, he moved to  Rollins College  in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a  M.Phil.  from  Cambridge , Gandhi initiated his professional career with the  Monitor Group , a management consulting firm in  London . Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded a technology outsourcing firm based in  Mumbai . He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the  Indian Youth Congress  and  National Students Union of India , while also being a trustee of the  Rajiv Gandhi Foundation  and  Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust .\n Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the  Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency  in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as  Leader of the Opposition .\n \n \n Early life and background \n Further information:  Nehru–Gandhi family \n Gandhi along with  Sonia Gandhi , then  POI   Pratibha Patil , then  VPOI   Ansari , then  PM  at the memorial of his grandmother  Indira Gandhi \n Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in  Delhi . [ 12 ]  He was the first of two children born to  Rajiv Gandhi , who later served as the 6th prime minister of India, and  Sonia Gandhi , who went on to become the  president of the Indian National Congress . As the grandson of former prime minister  Indira Gandhi , his lineage is deeply rooted in Indian political history. His paternal grandfather,  Feroze Gandhi , hailed from  Gujarat  and was of  Parsi  descent. [ 13 ]  Furthermore, he is the great-grandson of India's inaugural prime minister,  Jawaharlal Nehru .\n Gandhi completed his elementary education at  St. Columba's School  in New Delhi. [ 14 ]  He then attended  The Doon School  in Dehradun (an elite all-boys' boarding school, also the alma mater of his father,  Rajiv Gandhi ) from 1981 to 1983. [ 15 ]  At Doon, Gandhi studied alongside notable contemporaries, including former Congress members  Jyotiraditya Scindia  and  Jitin Prasada . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  Following the  assassination of Indira Gandhi  by Sikhs in her personal guard on 31 October 1984, his father entered politics and became the 6th prime minister of India. Due to security threats from  Sikh extremists , Gandhi and his sister Priyanka were  home-schooled , taking examinations under the supervision of teachers. [ 18 ]  Spending their childhood away from media attention, Gandhi and  his sister  kept low profiles, appearing with their parents at a handful of public occasions. [ 19 ] \n Gandhi joined  St. Stephen's College , Delhi, an affiliated college of the  University of Delhi , in 1989 for his undergraduate education. [ 20 ]  Gandhi's academic performance in Class XII, with a score of 61 per cent in the  CBSE school certificate , was perceived as not particularly strong. [ 21 ]  He gained admission to St. Stephen's College for  BA (Honors)  History through the sports quota, which granted a 10 per cent advantage in exam scores to promising athletes; per  National Rifle Association of India  testimonials, Gandhi stood 4th in the 32nd  National Shooting Competition  held in New Delhi from 26 December 1988 to 5 January 1989. [ 21 ]  Gandhi had finished fourth in the Centre Fire Pistol 25 M (Indian Rule) Men's civilian event with a score of 371 out of 400 points. [ 21 ]  By July 1989, Gandhi had won eight national awards. In 1991, following the  assassination of Rajiv Gandhi  by the  LTTE  during an election rally, Gandhi left St. Stephen's and moved to  Harvard University . Due to security concerns, he subsequently relocated to  Rollins College  in  Florida . He further went on to obtain an  Master of Philosophy  (MPhil) in  Development Studies , from  Trinity College , Cambridge in 1995. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  Following his father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, there was a heightened threat perception to the family, those closest to Gandhi were paranoid about his safety and might have forced him to take cover under the misleading surname \"Vinci\". [ 24 ] \n After completing higher education, Gandhi worked at the  Monitor Group , a  management consulting  firm set up by  Michael Porter  of  Harvard Business School , in  London  for three years. [ 25 ]  In 2002, he returned to India and established his  technology consultancy , Backops Services Private Ltd, in  Mumbai , where he served as one of the directors of the firm. [ 26 ]  Subsequently, he founded BackOps UK, a company that secured defence contracts from foreign suppliers. [ 27 ] \n \n Political career \n Formative years \n Rahul Gandhi (right) with  Hillary Clinton ,  Sonia Gandhi , and  Karan Singh  in New Delhi, 2009 \n In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the  14th general elections  from his father's former constituency of  Amethi  in  Uttar Pradesh  for the  Lok Sabha , India's lower house of parliament. [ 28 ]  His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of  Raebareli . When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister  Priyanka Gandhi  as the more charismatic and probable successor. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous  political family  would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population. [ 29 ]  In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce  caste  and  religious  tensions. [ 30 ] \n After being out of power for a record eight years, the Congress party returned to power, winning a total of 145 seats in the 2004 Indian general election. A  coalition government  was formed at the center by Congress with the backing of regional parties. Gandhi secured a victory by a substantial margin of over 100,000 votes, thereby maintaining the stronghold of his family in Uttar Pradesh. [ 31 ]  The party performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh, as it held 10 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with a vote share of 12.53 per cent. [ 32 ]   Gandhi did not hold any official role or position within the government. [ 33 ]  From 2004 to 2006, Gandhi served as a member for the  Standing Committee  on  Home Affairs . Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the member of the Standing Committee on  Human Resource Development . [ 34 ] \n Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, managed their mother's campaign for re-election to  Raebareilly  in 2006, which was won with a margin of over 400,000 votes. [ 35 ]  He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the  2007 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election ; Congress did not perform well in those elections, winning 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53 per cent of the vote. [ 36 ]  On 24 September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as the general secretary of the  All India Congress Committee , the governing body of the Congress party, as part of a reshuffle of the party secretariat. [ 37 ]  In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the  Indian Youth Congress  and the  National Students Union of India . [ 38 ] \n For the  2009 Indian general election , Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107  constituencies . [ 39 ] [ 40 ]  His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party's vision and agenda for the country. [ 41 ]  He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women's empowerment. Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country's future. [ 42 ]   The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led  United Progressive Alliance  (UPA) government. [ 43 ]  The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats. While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties. [ 44 ]  Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes. [ 45 ]  Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] \n \n Youth politics \n In September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the  Indian Youth Congress  (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the  National Students Union of India  (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community. [ 48 ]  As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations. After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million. [ 49 ]  The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in  New Delhi  to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC's  think tank . [ 52 ]  In 2009, during Gandhi's visit to  West Bengal , the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members. [ 53 ]  Similarly, the IYC acquired around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh. After his visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions. [ 54 ] \n While serving as the general secretary of the NSUI, Gandhi played an active role in strengthening the organisation and increasing  student participation  in politics. [ 50 ]  Under his leadership, the NSUI initiated programs and campaigns to address issues affecting the student community, such as the quality of education, employment opportunities, and social justice. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  Gandhi also advocated for greater student representation in decision-making processes and supported  student leaders  in their endeavours. [ 58 ] \n \n Congress leadership \n Ahead of the  2014 Indian general election , Gandhi was named the vice-president of the Indian National Congress, effectively making him the party's second-in-command. Gandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi, [ 59 ]  and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress. [ 60 ]  Gandhi retained the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP's  Smriti Irani , by a margin of 107,000 votes. [ 47 ] [ 61 ]  The Congress party suffered a massive defeat, winning 44 seats—its worst performance ever in the Lok Sabha elections. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  The UPA also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won 59 seats, compared to the 262 seats won in 2009. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]  Following the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign from his positions which was rejected by the Congress Working Committee. [ 66 ] \n Gandhi led the  2019 election campaign  of the Congress party. During  campaign, Gandhi announced \"Nyay\" (Nyuntam Aay Yojana— Minimum Income Guarantee) Scheme promising Rs 6,000 each to 20 per cent poorest households to his election speeches. [ 67 ]  Gandhi also promised to fill 22 lakhs government jobs within one year coming to power at the  Centre . Gandhi used the slogan \" Chowkidar Chor Hai \" as a jibe against Narendra Modi, BJP's prime ministerial candidate during his election rallies. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]  The slogan was aimed at Modi about the alleged irregularities and favouritism in awarding the contracts for the  Rafale fighter jet deal . [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  Post election results the INC won 52 seats, eight more than the previous election. Its vote percentage once again fell below 20 per cent. Gandhi won the Wayanad seat with over 60 per cent vote share. [ 72 ]  He lost his existing seat of Amethi to  Smriti Irani  of the BJP by a margin of 55,120 votes. [ 73 ] \n Ahead of the  2024 Indian general elections , Gandhi spearheaded political initiatives, including the  Bharat Jodo Yatra  and the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra , which were designed to address pressing social and economic issues facing the country. These campaigns aimed to foster unity and counter divisive politics, while also enhancing the visibility of the Indian National Congress (INC) among voters. The INC secured 99 seats in the elections, representing an improvement from previous electoral performances and allowing the party to reclaim the status of  Official Opposition  for the first time in ten years. In the elections, Gandhi successfully won the  Rae Bareli  constituency, succeeding his mother,  Sonia Gandhi . \n As a member of Parliament of India since 2004, Gandhi has served as a member of several  parliamentary committees  including  Home Affairs ,  Human Resource Development ,  External Affairs ,  Ministry of Finance  and  Corporate Affairs  and  Defence .\n \n National Herald case \n The  National Herald case  revolves around allegations of financial irregularities and misuse of funds related to the  National Herald  newspaper. The case garnered attention when former  BJP  leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders— Motilal Vora ,  Oscar Fernandes , Suman Dubey, and  Satyan Pitroda —of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald. The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to \"Associated Journals Limited\" (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper. [ 74 ]  Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around  ₹ 90 crore  (equivalent to  ₹ 202 crore or US$24 million in 2023), was not repaid. Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called \"Young India Ltd\" (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company's shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes. [ 74 ]  As per Swamy, YIL paid  ₹ 54 lakh  (equivalent to  ₹ 1.2 crore or US$140,000 in 2023) to get back ₹90 crore that Associated AJL owed to the Congress party. He also alleged that the loan given to AJL was illegal, as it had been taken from party funds. [ 74 ] \n The case went through various legal proceedings, including hearings in lower courts and the Delhi High Court. In December 2015, the  Delhi High Court  dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi and five others, ordering them to appear in person before the trial court. [ 75 ]  In 2015, the  Supreme Court of India  instructed Swamy to present arguments for expediting the trial in the high court. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were granted bail by the trial court on 19 December 2015. Subsequently, in 2016, the Supreme Court exempted all five accused individuals (including the Gandhis, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, and Suman Dubey) from personally attending court hearings, declining to dismiss the ongoing legal proceedings against them. [ 74 ]  In December 2020, the Delhi court dismissed a petition filed by then-BJP leader  Subramanian Swamy  seeking to summon Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and others as accused in the case. The court held that there was no  prima facie  evidence to suggest their involvement in any corruption conspiracy. [ 76 ]  In 2014, the  Enforcement Directorate  (ED) initiated an investigation into Swamy's complaint to determine if there were any indications of  money laundering . The investigation was closed due to technical reasons. Nonetheless, Swamy wrote to prime minister  Narendra Modi  expressing his suspicions about ED Director Ranjan Katoch. Subsequently, in 2015, Katoch was replaced, and the case was reopened. In December 2015, the  Patiala court  granted bail to the five individuals accused in the case. [ 77 ]  The Congress party objected to Swamy's complaint, calling it “ vindictive politics ”. [ 78 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n Gandhi during  Bharat Jodo Yatra \n The Bharat Jodo  Yatra , which translates to \"Unify India March,\" was a campaign organised by the Congress party spanning from 2022 to 2023 with the stated primary objective of promoting national unity and solidarity across the various regions of India. It aimed to mobilise support for the INC and its ideology, emphasising themes of patriotism, cultural heritage, and development. [ 79 ]  Gandhi started the initiative on 7 September 2022 at  Kanyakumari  after paying tributes to his late father  Rajiv Gandhi ,  Swami Vivekananda , and the Tamil poet  Thiruvalluvar . [ 80 ]  The yatra saw Gandhi along with INC leaders, including members of Parliament and notable personalities, travelling across the country, addressing rallies, conducting public meetings, and interacting with citizens. Throughout the yatra, Gandhi focused on issues such as  economic development ,  social justice , and inclusive governance, aiming to strengthen the party's grassroots presence and reinvigorate its political relevance on the national stage. [ 81 ] \n The yatra concluded on 29 January 2023 with the unfurling of the  tricolour flag  at  Lal Chowk ,  Srinagar ; [ 82 ]  it lasted 137 days, covering 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) over nearly five months across 12 states and two union territories. During the yatra, the INC elected a new  party president  and also won a majority in the  2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election , the first majority the party had won by itself since 2018. In the subsequent elections in Karnataka and Telangana in 2023, the Congress party achieved a landslide victory, marked by an increase in both the party's vote share and the number of seats compared to the previous elections in the constituencies through which the march had passed. [ 83 ] \n \n Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Main article:  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra \n Attendees displaying banners at the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra gathering \n From 14 January to 20 March 2024, Gandhi led a second yatra across India from east to west, the  Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ; unlike the previous version, the Yatra was conducted in a hybrid mode. [ 84 ] \n \n Disqualification \n Main article:  Disqualification of Rahul Gandhi \n On 13 April 2019, during a political rally in  Kolar ,  Karnataka, India  before the  17th general election , Gandhi made a remark in Hindi, questioning, \"Why is it that all thieves, whether it be  Nirav Modi ,  Lalit Modi , or  Narendra Modi , have Modi in their names?\". [ 85 ]  A speech comparing Narendra Modi with  Fugitive Economic Offenders  such as  Nirav Modi  and  Lalit Modi . A criminal defamation case was filed by  Purnesh Modi , a  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP) MLA from  Surat West . He alleged that Gandhi had defamed all individuals with the surname Modi. On 16 July 2019, the Surat court excused Gandhi from appearing personally in court due to short notice. On 10 October, he pleaded not guilty in the Surat Court, recording his statements and responding to questions here on 24 June 2021, and again on 29 October. During these appearances, he clarified to the court that he did not intend to defame any community. [ 86 ] \n On 23 March 2023, Gandhi was convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment under charges of defamation. The day following the conviction,  Utpal Kumar Singh , the Lok Sabha  secretary general , announced that Rahul Gandhi would be disqualified as a member of parliament representing the  Wayanad  constituency, effective from 23 March, the date of his conviction. The secretary general further said that this action was taken under Section 8 of the  Representation of the People Act, 1951  (RPA), which deals with the disqualification of convicted representatives in India. [ 87 ]  Gandhi's lawyer  Abhishek Manu Singhvi  appealed at the higher court and secured a one-month stay on the sentence. [ 88 ]  On 5 August, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on Gandhi's conviction and sentence, handed down by Chief Judicial Magistrate in Surat on 23 March 2023. [ 89 ] \n The disqualification of Gandhi prompted widespread reactions and responses, from the Congress party as well as other opposition leaders and lawmakers abroad. [ 90 ]  Legal experts questioned the basis of the charge, as defamation is only actionable against individuals and not a generic class of people. [ 3 ]  The  US House of Representatives ,  Ro Khanna ,  Democrat  co-chair of the India Caucus, described the removal of Gandhi from parliament as a \"deep betrayal\" of India's \"deepest values\". [ 91 ] [ 92 ]  A spokesperson for  Germany's foreign ministry  stated that  Berlin  had \"acknowledged\" the verdict and was monitoring the subsequent steps, including the possibility of an appeal and whether the \"suspension of his mandate\" was deemed justified. [ 93 ]   US Senator   Chris Van Hollen  made a separate comment, stating that the news of the disqualification was \"alarming\". [ 94 ] \n \n Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha (2024–present) \n Following the 2024 general election, he was nominated as the leader of the opposition in  Lok Sabha , reinforcing his role as a prominent figure within the party and the opposition landscape. In his first year in the role, he made 16 speeches in the  17th Lok Sabha , and pressured the government to conduct a nationwide  caste census ; this was adopted by the government in April 2025, as announced by the  Union Railway Minister   Ashwini Vaishnaw . [ 95 ]  Gandhi welcomed the decision, calling it \"the first step towards deep social reform\". [ 96 ] \n \n 2025 vote theft allegations \n Main article:  2025 Mahadevapura Electoral Controversy \n In August 2025, Gandhi alleged irregularities in voter rolls and polling processes, referring to the issue as “vote chori” (“vote theft”), during a press conference on 7 August. [ 97 ]  He cited examples from constituencies including  Mahadevapura  in Karnataka and presented documents which he said showed duplicate and fraudulent voter entries. The Election Commission of India subsequently asked him to provide formal evidence supporting the claims or to withdraw them. Later in the month, Gandhi expanded the allegations to cover multiple parliamentary constituencies and took part in public demonstrations organised by the Indian National Congress on the issue. [ 98 ] \n \n Political positions \n National security \n 68th   United States Secretary of State   John Kerry   with Gandhi at the Roosevelt House in New Delhi. \nIn December 2010, during the  United States diplomatic cables leak ,  WikiLeaks  leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009 after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the general secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the  United States ambassador to India ,  Timothy J. Roemer . In a \"candid conversation\" with Roemer, he said that he believes  Hindu extremists  pose a greater threat to his country than  Muslim  militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP). Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the  Islamist  militant organisation  Lashkar-e-Taiba  (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous  Muslim  population. [ 99 ]  In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson  Ravi Shankar Prasad  slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, \"In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in  Pakistan  and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security.\" Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. [ 100 ]  Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the  RSS  and has compared them to terrorist organisations like  SIMI . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Gandhi with Greek prime minister  George Papandreou  in  Chanakyapuri , New Delhi After the  2013 Muzaffarnagar riots  at a  Madhya Pradesh election rally  in Indore, Gandhi claimed that a police officer told him that Pakistan's military intelligence service,  ISI , was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters. [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The district administration, Uttar Pradesh state government, Union Home Ministry, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development. [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  This remark drew heavy criticism from various political outfits such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U). [ 107 ]  Congress's  Jairam Ramesh  said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for this remark. [ 108 ]  In reply to the  ECI's  show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn't intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics. [ 109 ] \n Lokpal \n Gandhi opines that the  Lokpal  should be made a  constitutional body  and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He opined that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption, rather a strong political will is needed to remove corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of  Anna Hazare 's fast. Gandhi's statement was considered a delaying tactic by the opposition and  Team Anna 's members. It was consequently slammed by opposition leaders  Sushma Swaraj  and  Arun Jaitley . [ 110 ]  The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the  Jan Lokpal Bill  report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal be made into a constitutional body.\n \n Farmers and land agitation \n  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  sits next to Gandhi who leads a delegation of leaders from  Bundelkhand  region in New Delhi. 2009 \n On 19 April 2015, Gandhi addressed the farmer and worker's rally, named as  Kisan Khet Mazdoor  Rally in  Ramlila Maidan . Here he made \"references to his agitations in  Niyamgiri  in  Orissa  and Bhatta-Parsaul in Greater Noida in  Uttar Pradesh \". [ 111 ]  The rally was attended by 100,000 people. In the speech he gave, he criticised the Indian prime minister  Narendra Modi  about his comment in  Toronto  where he said that he was \"cleaning the mess created by previous governments\". [ 112 ]  He also said, \"Do you know how Modi won the election?... He borrowed thousands of  crores  from industrialists for his several campaigns and advertisements. How will he pay them back? He will pay them back with your land. He will give your land to his industrialist friends.\" [ 111 ] \n He razzed the government as a \"suit-boot government\", a reference to Modi's monogrammed suit which he wore in the  Republic Day  meeting with  Barack Obama . Moreover, he used the \"acche din government\" jibe (which was Modi's election campaign slogan meaning \"good days government\") and mentioned that it had \"failed the country\". [ 113 ] \n A land bill was introduced by the BJP government in the parliament in May which was criticised by the opposition parties. [ 114 ]  Accusing the government of \"murdering\"  UPA 's land bill, [ 115 ]  Gandhi promised to prevent the bill from being passed, if not in the parliament then would \"stop you [  BJP  government] on streets\". He further accused the government of diluting the bill and called it \"anti-farmer\". [ 114 ]  Gandhi also drew a parallel between \"daylight robbery\" and the bill. [ 116 ]  On 26 May, the day of the Modi government's first anniversary, Gandhi commented at a rally in  Kozhikode  \"Unfortunately, birthday celebrations is only for a few powerful friends of the government. Kisan, farmers and mazdoor have nothing to celebrate.\" [ 117 ] \n \n Women's empowerment and LGBTQ rights \n .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:.5em 1.4em .8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:.5em 0 .8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5em auto .8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright span{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox>blockquote{margin:0;padding:0;border-left:0;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{text-align:center;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote>:first-child{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote:last-child>:last-child{margin-bottom:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" “ \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" ” \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quote-title,.mw-parser-output .quotebox .quotebox-quote{display:block}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:640px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{width:100%!important;margin:0 0 .8em!important;float:none!important}} \n \n \"India will be truly successful only when women occupy equal space in our society. They must take their rightful place in politics and shape India's destiny.\"\n \n \n Gandhi's remarks on Women empowerment. [ 118 ] \n  \n Gandhi has spoken publicly about the importance of  women's empowerment  and gender equality in India. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  While inaugurating 'Utsaah', a Kerala  Mahila Congress  convention in Kochi, Gandhi stated that the Congress party would actively promote women within its organizational structure and set a target to have 50 per cent of women as chief ministers within the next 10 years. Gandhi initiated the  Self-Help Groups  amongthe women in the villages of  Amethi . [ 121 ]  The primary focus of this scheme was to bring women together and empower them with information and decision making capabilities. [ 122 ]  He has called for increased representation of women in politics and for the eradication of gender-based violence. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ]  Under the  second Manmohan Singh ministry , a  Women's Reservation Bill  to require that a third of Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats be reserved for women was introduced in the  Rajya Sabha .  \nGandhi backed the bill, stating, \"Women do not need any protection. If you give them their rights, they can protect themselves\". [ 126 ]  This bill passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010, it never received a vote in the Lok Sabha and eventually lapsed due to its pending status. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In 2019, while addressing students in  Chennai , Gandhi again called for 33 per cent reservation of all parliamentary  Lok Sabha  and state legislative assembly seats for women, as well as government jobs. [ 131 ] \n On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India revoked  Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , an act which criminalised homosexual sex between adults. Gandhi supported this move, stating that he believed that issues related to personal freedom should be left to the individual. [ 132 ]  He opined that it's essential to uphold the constitutional guarantee of life and liberty to all citizens of India. [ 133 ]  Under Gandhi's leadership, the Congress appointed a transgender woman as national general secretary in the  women’s wing —seen as a step toward mainstreaming transgender individuals. [ 134 ] \n \n Climate and energy \n Gandhi advocates the transition to renewable energy sources and has called for increased investment in solar, wind, and other sustainable energy technologies. [ 135 ]  He has been very concerned about the  environmental degradation  of the world and has said that unless environmental problems are made a political issue, they will not get the attention they deserve. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] \n Gandhi criticised the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft by calling it \"dangerous\" and said that its long term consequences will be harmful. Calling it a disaster, he said that it will silence the communities who will be directly impacted by environmental degradation. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] \n \n Economy \n Gandhi at  Stanford University  in May 2023, delivers address on India's democracy, United States relationship \n Gandhi while addressing All India Congress Committee (AICC) in  Jaipur , called for an end to  red tape  and outdated laws that slow job creation. [ 140 ] \nGandhi views the economic policies of  Modi Government  as fundamentally to benefit the 2-3 billionaires and has described them as  crony capitalists . [ 141 ]  Calling the \"crony capitalists\" as best friends of Modi, he has been critical of the privatisation of government assets. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]  He is of the view that  RSS  and crony capitalists are colluding to control India. [ 144 ]  He has been specifically harsh on Indian billionaire  Gautam Adani , to whom he said the Modi Government has been very favourable. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ]  He sees the rise of Adani as a direct consequence of crony capitalism. [ 148 ] [ 149 ]  He said that he is not anti-business and supports fairness. [ 150 ]  Disagreeing with privatisation of  PSUs , he said that Congress will not allow the privatisation if it comes to power. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ]  Citing the report on inequality by  Oxfam , he said that rising economic inequality is the result of Modi Government's economic policies. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] \n \n Demonetisation \n Gandhi has been very critical of the  Modi government 's  demonetisation  of  ₹500  and  ₹1,000  banknotes of the  Mahatma Gandhi Series . [ 157 ]  He has called it a \"tragedy\" and a \"disaster\" that has negatively impacted the Indian economy and the lives of ordinary citizens. Gandhi has also accused the government of carrying out the policy without adequate planning and causing immense hardship to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. He said that demonetisation is a fundamental failure of policy design [ 158 ]  and has alleged that it was a deliberate move by \"PayPM\" to help 2-3 billionaires to monopolise the economy. Terming demonetisation as the country's “biggest scam”, [ 159 ] \n During his public speeches and political rallies, Gandhi has consistently criticised the demonetisation move, claiming that it failed to achieve its intended objectives of combating black money and curbing corruption. [ 160 ]  He has also argued that the policy was implemented without proper consultation with experts or the  opposition parties . Gandhi further asserted that, demonetisation caused significant disruption to farmers, and rendered millions jobless in small and medium-sized businesses, and workers in the informal sector.

[ 97 ]  He cited examples from constituencies including  Mahadevapura  in Karnataka and presented documents which he said showed duplicate and fraudulent voter entries. The Election Commission of India subsequently asked him to provide formal evidence supporting the claims or to withdraw them. Later in the month, Gandhi expanded the allegations to cover multiple parliamentary constituencies and took part in public demonstrations organised by the Indian National Congress on the issue.

    "In December 2010, during the  United States diplomatic cables leak ,  WikiLeaks  leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009 after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the general secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the  United States ambassador to India ,  Timothy J. Roemer . In a \"candid conversation\" with Roemer, he said that he believes  Hindu extremists  pose a greater threat to his country than  Muslim  militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the  Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP). Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the  Islamist  militant organisation  Lashkar-e-Taiba  (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous  Muslim  population. [ 99 ]  In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson  Ravi Shankar Prasad  slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, \"In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in  Pakistan  and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security.\" Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India. [ 100 ]  Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the  RSS  and has compared them to terrorist organisations like  SIMI . [ 101 ] [ 102 ]",
